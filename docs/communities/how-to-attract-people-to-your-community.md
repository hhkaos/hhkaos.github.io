# How to attract new people to our community ðŸ§²

The degree of involvement/participation of people in a community changes over time. Therefore, to **maintain the activity of the community it is important** to capture the attention and **get new people to come and, but most importantly, to make them want to come back**.
 
**The main tips** for attracting new people to the community I would summarize as::

* [Lower the barrier to entry](#lower-the-barrier-to-entry).
* [Create content and disseminate it](#create-content-and-disseminate-it).
* [Move, be nomads](#move-be-nomads).
* [Encourage diversity](#encourage-diversity).
* [Consider disruptive approaches](#consider-disruptive-approaches).

### Lower the barrier to entry

The easier it is to have a first contact with the people you are already part of, the better.  Therefore, the first tip is that (if you don't already have one) you should create a **two-way channel where you can interact **in a more "private" way. I mean, a Discord, Telegram, Slack, ... 

Include a specific channel where everyone has the opportunity to introduce themselves:

**Giving the possibility to start the first contact behind the keyboard can help the most timid people**, first observing ðŸ‘€ before encouraging them to take the first step. 

We, with the [GeoVoluntarios](https://web.archive.org/web/20220116222822/https://geovoluntarios.org/) community, from which we were connecting digital volunteers with organizations during the beginning of the pandemic, even **[went so far as to organize some "office hours" or daily AMA](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwq5dz_FjCx4Y3AQKr4q0EAlKbtGpXQ3V)** where anyone could connect and introduce themselves, and then orient them and connect them with other people in the community with related interests so they could help. Obviously, you don't have to go to that extreme, but you can organize periodic online meetings (with optional camera) to break the ice.

If you want to be more original, you can try tools such as [Gather Town](https://app.gather.town/app):

For more "disruptive" approaches, at GeoDevelopers for example, we spent some time doing online/virtual coworking through Discord and [promoting it through Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/853855361?collection=JxxICOsuVRbGfA) to make us even more accessible, in a similar manner to the [#studywithme](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/studywithme), [#focus](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/FOCUS), [#pomodoro](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/pomodoro), [#coworkingstream](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/all/tags/coworkingstream).  

### Create content and disseminate it

I guess this is pretty obvious, but just in case I'm saying it.

If you have the opportunity I recommend **recording or streaming all the events you can**, take photos, and share it afterwards **so people can come by, watch from the sidelines**, and hopefully generate enough interest to take the step to participate.

Share it all **through a public channel** (Instagram, LinkedIn, X, Meetup, TikTok, Facebook, ...). Use tools like [StreamYard](https://streamyard.com/) or [Restream](https://restream.io) to broadcast on multiple video platforms simultaneously, Ivoox to publish your podcasts, etc. And always remember to indicate how to join the bidirectional channel. Take advantage of as many channels as possible to advertise your events, and hopefully allow anyone to sign up for and share your events.

</figure>

</div>

As for which channels/social networks work best... I wouldn't presume to say any, it usually depends on the audience, age, location, etc. I would start by **asking people in the community which channel they prefer to receive notifications** of new meetings and published resources (email, social networks, shared calendar, instant messaging, RSS, web/meetup, push notifications, ...), and enable as many as possible.

One option is to set up a tool like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/)/[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)/[Make](https://www.make.com/en) that automates republishing between networks, at least until you see which one works best for you, although ideally you should find a user of this/these and make them responsible for it/them. It is not necessary to share daily, but at least the "pre" and "post" event would be advisable. 

Otherwise, try to create a unique hashtag, X list, mailing list, or similar that interested people can follow to be aware of what is happening, and **use a tool like "[Share link creator](https://www.websiteplanet.com/webtools/sharelink/) "** when you publish a meeting, and ask the whole community and followers to help you spread the word.

### Move, be nomads

"_If the Mountain wonâ€™t go to Mohammed, then Mohammed must come to the Mountain_".

**Don't always stay in the same place**. As an organizer, I know that finding a "headquarters" and always holding events there is the most comfortable for you. However, one of the best ways to attract new people to a community, whether it is starting from scratch, or if it is old but stagnant and you are just looking to "revitalize" it, is by contacting training or professional centers in your area (e.g. academies, high schools, colleges, universities, adult education centers, etc.) and holding the events there.  

<div class="half" style={{  textAlign: 'center' }}>

<figure>

</figure>

</div>

Contact them, find out what you could offer them that might interest them and consider the possibility of holding a future meeting there. Examples of things you could offer: sharing experiences about your professional reality, your career paths, new technologies you master, review of the landscape of communities, talk about conferences and [other educational channels](https://www.rauljimenez.info/docs/developers/educational-developers-channels), etc. 

This also applies to online communities. Connect with other online communities, look for related interests and propose joint events. And if it were me, I would broadcast those collaborations on both communities' channels using the platforms mentioned above.

### Encourage diversity

Organize events in **other languages**, and let me repeat myself... contact other communities, look for interests that you have in common to see if it is worthwhile to organize an event or an agenda of joint events. 

If yours is real life community, look for **other local communities,** user groups (you can search in [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com), facebook, etc. ), **associations** (maybe you can get a list of the associations registered in your city council), contact **AMYPA** of schools (if you have families in the community or through their websites), **entrepreneur groups** (Young Entrepreneurs Association, business networks like Chambers of commerce, [incubators, accelerators, entrepreneurship centers](https://startupxplore.com/en/map),  

In the document on "How to encourage new people to give talks" we will also talk about [create-safe-environments](/docs/communities/how-to-encourage-people-to-participate). 

I haven't personally checked out the [Awesome Diversity](https://github.com/folkswhocode/awesome-diversity#readme) repository, but if you need more ideas... I think it's worth a look.


### Consider disruptive approaches

If you have tried all of the above and it still doesn't work for you... something that could happen, since for example there are technologies that "go out of fashion" (e.g. [PhoneGap meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PhoneGap-SF/)), and others could be very niche topics (e.g. [Lambda World](https://www.meetup.com/lambda-world-programming-meetup/)), I think there are only disruptive approaches left. 

In that case, if you really think you need to attract more people, consider:

* **Merge the community with another community with similar interests** (local or online).
* **Make more virtual meetings** (if you are not doing it yet).
* **Broaden the range of topics you cover**.

The reality is that people's time is limited, **and if our proposal is not sufficiently attractive** or does not cover the needs and interests of the people we want to reach ... no matter how much we want to, **we will not be able to attract them**<sup>*</sup>.
