# Educational channels

> **Note**: This page include +250 educational channels **for developers**.

There is a widely held belief among developers that **this profession requires continuous learning**, mainly to stay current and competitive. This is due to the fast pace software technologies emerge and evolve, and that's probably right, **but please hold you [fear of missing out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) feeling**, you don't need to adopt every trend. 

Said that, it's good to keep up to date, that's why I have made this compilation where you can find relevant content that you can add to a [news aggregators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_aggregator), or subscribe (channels / newsletters / podcasts / ...), or follow other people to help you with this.

For me, the **best way to keep up with developer technologies is to engage with highly motivated and passionate developers**. So, if you don't find those people in your current environment, I encourage you to find them in a [developer community](#communities) that matches your passion and interests.

> **Note**: As soon as you feel prepared, I encourage you to contribute too, that's why I have separated those mediums accepting contributions in it's own section. In addition to those, you can always search for organization with developer relations teams and get in touch with them (e.g. [companies list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i4ge1DcQGxIyiC3lOOWZJFw_aJPyY3T8GDDhvdx__hc/edit?usp=sharing), [DevRel careers](https://devrelcareers.com/), or check in Linkedin). Many of us are happy to help/guide you on how to do it.

> **📥 Contribute to podcasts**: Many, or I would say... most podcasts use to have guests or interview relevant people to their podcasts. So identify relevant podcasts where you think you could contribute and engage with the host to assest if you are right. There are tools to match hosts and guests (check: [How to Get On Podcasts as a Guest in 2024: The Easy Way](https://edwardsturm.com/articles/get-on-podcasts-as-guest-2024/))
