# What is this?

Welcome to my Digital Brain ðŸ§ .

If there is something that I have always disliked is creating content and resources and leaving them in a drawer, so I have decided to create this section to share resources that I have been creating for different reasons (helping acquaintances, my concerns, ventures, things that I want to share, etc.) with the community,

In this section, I will be [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), specifically, by sharing knowledge I get based on my experience, research, etc.

Here you will find open resources that I'm building on my continuous learning path.

This is one of my ways of [learning in public](https://gist.github.com/sw-yx/70d3ab5e9b18ff2ebdddcf45cd74ca47), so feel free to take any of the resources, **they are licensed under [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**.

:::info

It is not my intention to translate all the resources (with exceptions), but any contribution is more than welcome ðŸ˜‰.
