# What is this?

Welcome to my Digital Brain ðŸ§ .

**I have always disliked creating content and resources and leaving them in a drawer**, so I have decided to create this section to share resources that I have been creating for different reasons, like personal projects, helping friends, sharing things I enjoyed, etc.

This will probably take years, so I decided to create **[this issue to compile many of these resources](https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/issues/1#issue-1701390134)** ðŸ“¦.

So, this is one of my ways of [learning in public](learn-in-public) and giving back to the community, so **feel free to take any of the resources, they are licensed under [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)**.

:::info

It is not my intention to translate all the resources (with exceptions), but any contribution is more than welcome ðŸ˜‰.
