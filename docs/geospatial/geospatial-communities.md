# Geospatial communities

The geospatial ecosystem is vast, dynamic, and constantly evolving. Across the globe, professionals, enthusiasts, researchers, and organizations come together to explore, develop, and advance geospatial technologies. From GIS and cartography to earth observation, spatial data science, and humanitarian mapping, the diversity of topics and participants reflects the growing impact of geospatial technologies in countless industries.

**This openly available, community-driven spreadsheet compiles geospatial communities, including conferences, meetups, competitions, hackathons, and more.**
