# My facets

Mainly due to my curiosity and entrepreneurial spirit, over the years I have worn many different hats, which has led me to develop a multifaceted profile:
* Software developer
* Community leader & manager
* Networker
* Content producer
* Product manager
* Entrepreneur
* Mentor
* Communicator
* Marketer / SEO / Growth hacker
* Developer Advocate
* Strategist
* ...

That is why I have developed skills in many of these fields and learned to use a wide variety of tools.
