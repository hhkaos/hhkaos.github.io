# My personal journey

## My childhood

Below I am going through the main milestones in my early life that led me to love computers and became a software engineer:

* **Late 80's-early 90's** (~6-7 years): My first contact with computers started when my older brother was given an [Amstrad CPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) with which we spent hours playing computer games like Ghosts'N Goblins, Contra, Double Dragon, Shadow Warriors, etc.
* **~1991-1992** (~8 years old): My father bought an [i486](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I486) and I had to learn how to use using MS-DOS, [Norton Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander), etc. Although the main thing I did at that time was to keep playing games like [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(franchise)) and [Duke Nukem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem).
* **~1993** (~9 years old): [Windows 3.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x) came out, and among other programs I spent many hours with [my cousin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pablo-perez-ortega-0a382747/) talking to [HERBIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSmsn5kWts), an amazing conversational chatbot (made by Rafael García González in 1985) that felt like ChatGPT these days, but also creating movies with "[Cartooners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmjRKd9E7Cw)" which remind me a rudimentary version of [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_programming_language) nowadays. 
* **~1995** (~11 years old): My brother, with the help of a book, taught me how to develop in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) using [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic). Inspired by the role-playing games we used to play together, I created my first [choose your own adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) game type, based on *IF*, *ELSE*, *GOTO* and a few more statements (a nightmare!! 🤣... and full of bugs).
* **~1996** (~12 years old): My father brought a modem (28.8k) home. I still remember how, before discovering [Lycos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycos), my cousin and I thought that the whole internet was just a single website (elguebon.com) where we spent hours chatting with other users through [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape). This fascinated me... and a couple of years later it would lead me to want to learn how to make webs.
* **~1997** (~13 years old): I met a guy older than me (from Seville) who had just started to study computer science and who spent the summer vacations in [Nerja](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HqctuqxNHZnvxEPs7), the town where I grew up. He taught me the [Delphi language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Delphi_(software)), and although I tried my best at creating a Doom-like game, I never got very far.
* **~1998** (~14 years old): I discovered [Microsoft Frontpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage) and started building web pages, familiarizing myself with HTML, adding basic styles with CSS, layout with tables, very basic Javascript, and [ActiveX controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX). Everything got more interesting when a classmate ([Chema](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chemadiezdelcorral/)) taught me how to create animations with [Macromedia Flash](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) and [ActionScript](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript). I started publishing them in [Geocities.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) and [Tripod.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod_(web_hosting)) a year after.
* **~1999** (~15 years old): We were taught to program with [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) in high school, although I didn't do much with it. Around that time in addition to [MSN Messenger](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Messenger), I discovered [Terra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(company)) & [IRC](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat), and joined [IRC-Hispano](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC-Hispano) where I met an [ethical hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic) that taught me what trojans were, specifically [Sub7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub7), and how to use it (for joking around), told me about [keyloggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging), showed me how to hide text in images using [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) software, ... But also, at the same time and influenced by my brother, I started playing [StarCraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft), and where my nickname comes from ([@hhkaos](https://twitter.com/hhkaos)), because I was \[HH\]KaoS at the HH (Hell Hounds) clan.
* **Late 2001** (~17 years old): One of my brother's friends told me about [HackHispano.com](https://foro.hackhispano.com/), and how he was able to make a Slimcard that allowed him to do free calls from [phone booths](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Cabina_de_tel%C3%A9fono_Telefonica_Madrid.jpg). This aroused my curiosity, and [I learned how to do it too](https://foro.hackhispano.com/threads/1340-Slimcard-SMD-terminada(Componentes)). I made very good friends there, who among other things... introduced me to [Red Hat Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat_Linux).
* **~2002** (~18 years old): After doing the *[Selectividad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectividad)* (the Spanish University admission tests), I decided that I would do [computer engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering) in the University of Granada, where it was not yet clear to me what I would specialize in next, but from my second year of studies, it was clear to me that what I liked the most was web development.

 > **Note**: Here is a video that not only shows me [how the popularity of web pages has evolved since 1993-2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNDILCdZmRo), but also reminds me of how old I am getting... 👴🏻🤣.

Looking backwards... I guess I can consider myself a technologist at heart, because I have always found a way to be involved with technologies not out of obligation, but out of passion for it.

## Adult stage

I will continue adding milestones about my professional development and the different stages I have been going through. For now, you can check [my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimenezortegaraul/)
