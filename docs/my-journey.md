# ✈️ My personal journey

I have been in contact with technology since I was ~6-7 years old. Below I am going through the main milestones in my early life that led me to love computers and became a computer scientist:
* **Late 80's-early 90's** (~6-7 years): My older brother was given an [Amstrad CPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) with which we spent hours playing computer games(Ghosts'N Goblins, Contra, Double Dragon, Shadow Warriors, etc.)
* **~1991-1992** (~8 years old): My father bought an i486 with which I started using MS-DOS, [Norton Commander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norton_Commander), etc. Although the main thing I did was to keep playing games like [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(franchise)) and [Duke Nukem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_Nukem).
* **~1993** (~9 years old): [Windows 3.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1x) came out, and among other programs I spent many hours with my cousin talking to [HERBIE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wSmsn5kWts), a conversational chatbot (made by Rafael García González in 1985), and creating cartoons with "[Cartoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2THuctqMXis)" (a very rudimentary version but similar to [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)) nowadays). 
* **~1995** (~11 years old): My brother, with the help of a book, taught me how to develop in [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) using [QBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic). Inspired by the role-playing games we used to play together, I created my first "role-playing game" ([choose your own adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) type) based on *IF*, *ELSE*, *GOTO* and a few more statements (a nightmare!! 🤣... and full of bugs).
* **~1996** (~12 years old): My father brought a modem (28.8k) home. I still remember how, before discovering [Lycos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycos), my cousin and I thought that the whole internet was just a single website (elguebon.com) where we spent hours chatting with other users through [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape), which fascinated me and a couple of years later it would lead me to want to learn how to make webs.
* **~1997** (~13 years old): I met a guy older than me (from Seville) who had just started to study computer science and who was living in my town. He taught me the [Delphi language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Delphi_(software)), although I didn't use it very much..
* **~1998** (~14 years old): I discovered [Frontpage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage) and started creating and experimenting with web pages, familiarizing myself with HTML, adding basic styles with CSS, layout with tables, very basic Javascript, and [ActiveX controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX). Everything got more interesting when a classmate taught me how to create animations with [Macromedia Flash](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) and [ActionScript](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript). I started publishing them in [Tripod.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod_(web_hosting)) for free.
* **~1999** (~15 years old): We were taught to program with [Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)) in high school, although I didn't do anything else either. Around that time in addition to [MSN Messenger](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Messenger) I discover [IRC](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) and joined IRC-Hispano and an ethical hacker taught me what trojans were (specifically [Sub7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub7)) and how to use it, which generated some fear in me and I did not dare to use it for more than a few days.  I Influenced by my brother, I also started playing [StarCraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft) seriously, which I continued to do for many years and which will lead me to develop my first serious websites in college.
* **Late 2001** (~17 years old): A friend of my brother's told me about HackHispano.com and how he had created a card that allowed free calls from phone booths. This aroused my curiosity and [I learned how to do it too](https://foro.hackhispano.com/threads/1340-Slimcard-SMD-terminada(Componentes)). There I made some very good friends, who among other things introduced me to Linux/Red Hat.
* **~2002** (~18 years old): After doing the *[Selectividad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selectividad)* (the Spanish University Admission Tests), I decided that I would do higher engineering in computer science in the University of Granada, where it was not yet clear to me what I would specialize in next.

 > **Note**: Here is a video that not only shows me [how the popularity of web pages has evolved since 1993-2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNDILCdZmRo), but also reminds me of how old I am getting... 👴🏻🤣.
