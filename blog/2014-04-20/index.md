# ðŸ§  Having a poor memory it's not so bad

Today I wanted to share another thought I had, this time it is: "**everything has a positive side, even having a bad memory**", although perhaps Leonard Shelby (from [Memento](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film))) wouldn't think the same xD.

Those who know me know that I am a quite active person, always coming up with new ideas, projects, etc., and you know that I always say I have a bad memory (which is true). Sometimes I think it's because I don't exercise my memory much, although sometimes I think it's due to my "hyperactivity."

Who knows why.... the thing is, sometimes it "annoys me" to think that "I am this way," but this time I reflected and thought... well... having a bad memory is not always bad. Why? In my opinion, because:

1.  **It forces me to be more structured**, for example:
    -   When it comes to work, I try to document all procedures.
    -   Procedures or work that I later share; for example, in articles on this blog like: [Partner Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2014/04/06/pacto-de-socios/), [Template for Creating an Analytics Plan](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2014/01/06/plantilla-para-crear-un-plan-de-analitica/), etc.
    -   I tend to use many task management tools that I later reuse in my work.
2.  Also, **I make myself write more** about what I have done so I don't forget it
    1.  For example, my [life summary posts](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/category/sobre-mi/) which also serve to keep my friends updated on how I am.
    2.  And to share [articles like this one](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2013/12/08/el-trabajo-perfecto/), which are thoughts I want to internalize (and writing helps).
3.  And finally, it also **helps you forget problems sooner or lessen the importance** of many of them.

In short, if someone ever criticizes you for having a bad memory, maybe you can counter-argue that... having a bad memory also has its advantages, what do you think?

By the way, this reasoning also applies to "**having scattered attention**," anyone dare to justify the good in this? ^_^
