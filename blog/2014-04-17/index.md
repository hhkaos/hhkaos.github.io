# My new job at Esri

As I mentioned in a [previous article](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2014/03/28/resumen-de-los-sucedido-desde-agosto/ "Resumen de lo sucedido desde Agosto"), I have joined the Esri Spain team as a **Developer Program Manager**... and what does that entail? Very simple: helping and inspiring developers to create applications that solve problems related to location (whether it's the user's location or anything else).

For those of you who are not familiar with the company, let me tell you that [Esri](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.esri.com/) is a company that started in the United States over 40 years ago (currently with more than 3,000 employees [worldwide](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.esri.com/about-esri/offices)) and, in my opinion, has created the best software in the Geographic Information Systems (GIS) sector: [ArcGIS](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://arcgis.com/).

And what is that used for? Well, let me give you several examples:

- Identifying the [best areas to live within a city](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://uji.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Filter/index.html?appid=96848387cd1a4ffeaf0bbc1a98699640) (based on certain criteria)
- Solving problems like: [what is the best location for my next business?](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.forbes.com/sites/barbarathau/2014/04/24/how-big-data-helps-retailers-like-starbucks-pick-store-locations-an-unsung-key-to-retail-success/)
- Creating [location-aware mobile applications](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.fastcolabs.com/3028819/the-big-question-in-retail-now-is-what-are-you-doing-with-geotriggers) that incorporate behaviors associated with their location.
- Setting up [dynamic and interactive 3D scenarios](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.arcgis.com/apps/CEWebViewer/viewer.html?3dWebScene=9c0e319bfaff4d33a0fe2da97c2c3fd7) (similar to Second Life)
- Representing and communicating large amounts of information in a more understandable ([map of England](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://illustreets.co.uk/explore-england)) or attractive way ([map with incredible places](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/?appid=35926d0e1c7741b59948ca45f4f33b3a)).
- [Conducting simulations](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://mappingpoint.blogspot.com.es/2014/01/terremotos-en-la-isla-del-hierro.html), analyzing geolocated data ([e.g., purchases](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://grupoweb.upf.es:8080/quartz/)) and predicting future situations ([queues in stores, etc](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/https://www.centrodeinnovacionbbva.com/en/pages/29293-winners)).
- [Other examples](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.geoases.com/inspiracion/)

So, it can be used to solve problems, optimize processes, communicate better, etc., and therefore, the applications are numerous and can be useful for individuals, companies, and governments.

If you are a programmer and are interested in learning more about this field, I invite you to **[join the Geo Developers Meetup](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.meetup.com/Geo-Developers/)** that I created to organize talks, workshops, etc., and help each other by sharing knowledge.

See you soon! ![:D](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438im_/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif)
