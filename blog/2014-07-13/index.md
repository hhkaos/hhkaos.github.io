# How Google Glass works

For a long time, I wanted to experience how [Google Glass](http://www.google.es/glass/start/) works, and after a long wait, I have finally been able to try it myself (and with calm). So for those of you who had the same questions as I did, I decided to record these videos where I try to explain how they work.

<!-- In this first video, I explain a bit about **how the interface works**: -->

In this video, I do a **mini demo** (as far as the glasses allowed me xD):

I would love for you to tell me if it is clear, ask me any questions you have, if you want to see something specific, etc.

Hugs!
