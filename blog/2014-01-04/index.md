# ðŸ’° Investing in online training

Many people still hesitate to take the step of paying a fee to subscribe to a good online training service; and today I wanted to advocate for it because I believe it is more cost-effective compared to other formal training alternatives. In my case, I decided to bet on [CodeSchool](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://www.codeschool.com/) in June of last year, for me **the best platform** that exists to stay updated and **improve programming skills**.

Personally, when it comes to educational platforms, I prefer those that require me to submit exercises to obtain certification, as they involve putting what I've learned into practice and therefore, I believe, provide some validity. Here are a few other platforms with MOOCs that follow this line where you can find free courses (with paid certifications): [Coursera](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://coursera.org/), [Miriadax](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://miriadax.net/), [CodeAcademy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://www.codecademy.com/), and [EDX](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.edx.org/) (_thanks Pino for this last one!_).

Well, in my case I pay a **$25 per month** subscription on Codeschool, which over these months (including discounts) has amounted to about â‚¬125, and although this may seem like a considerable amount, I think if we analyze what I've gained in return it offers a different perspective.

For example, during this time I have [completed 9](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/users/227734) of the 36 courses they have available:

â€“ [Javascript Road Trip Part 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1) **(Free)**  
â€“ [Javascript Road Trip Part 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-2)  
â€“ [Javascript Road Trip Part 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-3)  
â€“ [Coffeescript](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/coffeescript)  
â€“ [Real-Time-Web with Node.js](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-nodejs)  
â€“ [Discover DevTools](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/discover-devtools) **(Free)**  
â€“ [Fundamentals of Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/fundamentals-of-design)  
â€“ [Try Git](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) **(Free)**  
â€“ [Try Ruby](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ruby)

Doing the math, each paid course has cost me about â‚¬20 and I have invested ... I would say between 4 and 8 hours in each. If we do the math, I think it comes at a very reasonable price since the courses are of tremendous quality and include a lot of practical exercises that I believe **are making me a better professional**.

What do you think about this, in **comparison to other training options**: workshops, training sessions, master's programs, etc. **Don't you think it's a good price?**
