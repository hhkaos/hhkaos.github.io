# What Happened Since April 2014

### Google Glass and Android Wear

Although I already told you that I had acquired Google Glass and [how they worked](/blog/como-funcionan-las-google-glass), since September I also have a [G Watch](https://play.google.com/store/devices/details/LG_G_Watch_Black_Titan?id=lg_g_watch_black&hl=en) with Android Wear. Additionally, I have been motivated to develop a basic geolocated alerts application that works both [on the watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lImhDJYrnt4&list=PLwq5dz_FjCx7Q8qLN45nJqNXz7hBdNgeN) and [on the glasses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVvgNtIxdNo&list=PLwq5dz_FjCx7Q8qLN45nJqNXz7hBdNgeN&index=3).

### We Won the 1st BEEVA Hackathon

On September 25th, I participated in a BEEVA (BBVA) Hackathon where we won first prize with the development of a geolocated promotions application prototype for smartwatches with [Android Wear](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/https://developer.android.com/wear/index.html) and [ArcGIS Online](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/http://developers.arcgis.com/en/).

### Iniciador Madrid

On September 26th, I attended the Global Meeting of Iniciador, an event organized by the [Iniciador Foundation](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/http://iniciador.com/) for organizers and former organizers to discuss various issues affecting the organization.

There, I was able to reconnect with many old friends and meet new ones, but the best part is that after that event, I decided to collaborate with Iniciador again both at the national and local levels. So, starting this month, I will be helping organize [Iniciador Madrid](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/http://iniciador.com/madrid/).

On October 6th, I was on [Capital Radio's Afterwork program](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/http://www.capitalradio.es/programas/after-work/) in an interview with [Enrique O’Connor](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/http://es.linkedin.com/in/enriqueoconnor), founder of [Spotlinker](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/http://www.spotlinker.com/).

### Esri Spain Conference

On October 22nd and 23rd, we held the [annual Esri Spain conference](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/http://evento.esri.es/es/ce14/?utm_source=home-esri-es), a large event where we showcased the full power of the [ArcGIS](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/http://developers.arcgis.com/en/) platform to professionals of all kinds. Here is a video where I demonstrated a mini-application I developed for my watch with [Android Wear](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/https://developer.android.com/wear/index.html) ^_^.

You can find all the conference videos on the [Esri Spain YouTube account](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoptan2utx17yQLSiUPiJeqtMD_LPb9H0).

### University Tour

During October, I also went on a [university tour](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/http://desarrolladores.esri.es/geo-developer-communities/) visiting Seville, Castellón, Complutense in Madrid, and Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona) to explain the professional opportunities available if they specialize in application development using technologies we offer at Esri ([ArcGIS](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419165740/http://developers.arcgis.com/en/)).
