Today I am writing to announce that in [üß† My digital brain](/docs/digital-brain) I have added a new section to collect resources directed people who energize [üåà Tech communities](/docs/category/-tech-communities) in the hope that they will help **create more sustainable communities over time**.

## New resources section

Following the [document I produced last year after the Open Space (üá™üá∏)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1txUERZ8vcXD2F99_WbiQO-lryAVk6ftUS3OuGwDVNZ4/edit?usp=sharing) **with help from several people**, I have published three resources:

* [üìÑ How to attract new people to our community](/docs/communities/how-to-attract-people-to-your-community)
* [üìÑ How to keep people's interest](/docs/communities/how-to-keep-peoples-interest)
* [üìÑ How to encourage new people to give lectures](/docs/communities/how-to-encourage-people-to-participate)

I have also created varios "_placeholders_" on resources that I hope to develop based on input from the upcoming Open Space<sup>(1)</sup>:

* [üìÑ How to finance communities](/docs/communities/how-to-finance-communities)
* [üìÑ How do you encourage others to energize](/docs/communities/how-to-encourage-other-people-to-energize)
* [üìÑ Tools to manage a community](/docs/communities/tools-to-manage-a-community)
* [üìÑ Other resources for *community leaders](/docs/communities/other-resources-for-community-organizers)

> **(1)** Next week is [CommitConf 2024](https://2024.commit-conf.com/en/), where the OpenSpace on "**How to sustain technical communities**" that [Dani Rey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-rey-rey-9022702a/), [Oskar Calvo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oskarcalvo) and I have proposed will take place, which will be "the continuation" of last year's Open Space where some of the challenges facing technical communities were discussed.

At the end **[I have added a list of people who have contributed](#contributions)** to this work. 

## Communities in recess?

Are the communities in recess, are the communities having more problems now than before?

After talking to many people, and in different forums, such as Open Space, my perception is that there is a general feeling about the **drop of activity in many of the technology communities** (both in Spain and abroad) **in the last few years**, especially since the pandemic.

By "drop of activity" I mean a mix of things, but mainly I mean a lower attendance to meetings (face-to-face and online), interactions in mailing lists/IMs, etc.

And this situation, as is normal, worries those of us who energize communities.

One of the concerns that I have heard recurrently is that the average age of the people who are part of these communities is growing, or what is the same, that **it is difficult to attract and engage the new generations**. 

Personally, I am reluctant to believe that this is because the experience offered by the communities no longer provides as much value to the new generations as other new formats, channels or "forums". 

But before we continue... what is a community?

## What is a community?

Or rather, **what do I mean by community, or technology community**?

Perhaps it is good to start with this question, since for example, during the Commit Open Space, in my opinion, there were times when the conversation revolved around different concepts of "community". 

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<figure>

[![Vibrant meeting space, technologists gather with faces animated by enthusiasm.](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/user-group-meetup-tech-community.png)](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/user-group-meetup-tech-community.png)

</figure>

</div>

In my case, I talk about what is known as "[communities of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice)", which in short are **groups of people**(user groups, associations, meetups...) that:

* **organize regular meetings** (face-to-face and/or online).
* **share a passion / profession / concerns, ... for technology** (software, hardware, methodologies or best practices, ...).
* mainly, **seek to collaborate with each other, voluntarily and altruistically**.
* they **seek the common benefit** above the particular one (including the particular interest of the organizations that may support/sponsor them).
* are **always open to new people**.
* feel part of the group and identify with it.

So, I just wanted to clarify that:
1. This is in my experience and is based primarily on the type of communities I just described. 
2. I believe that most of the ideas and tips shared in [the documents](/docs/category/-tech-communities), can be applied to this type of communities, whether they are local (in small and in big cities), as much as online/virtual, regardless of the fact that each one has its peculiarities.

Having said all of the above, it does not detract from the fact that some of **the tips can also be applied to people who are in the business of disseminating online content, or people who organize large conferences**. 

## What has changed?

Why do those of us who have been energizing communities have this feeling/perception?

To give some context, I started to get involved with this particular type of communities at the university (in ~2009), and since then [I have participated, contributed, founded and co-organized quite a few communities](https://www.rauljimenez.info/docs/about-me/open-culture#communities), organizing hundreds of meetings (of all kinds).

Based on this experience, I would say that the feeling that activity is declining is mainly due to the fact that **it is harder for us to provide value** as we did before.

Now the offer is wider and the attention is diversifying with the increase of communities, channels/media (Discords, Slacks, RRSS, ...), but also the rise of [influencers](https://twitter.com/i/lists/828546487369990144/members). 

![The image shows a cluttered room, a person hiding behind his hands, drowned between screens and cables.](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/information-saturation-noise-social-networks.png)

Personally I also think that digital contact is eating more ground to the physical, just see that **almost everything is done through apps**: order food, a cab, talk / chat, procedures with the administration, ... even flirting! üòÖ and I have no doubt that this also has consequences. 

That is why I believe that it is not that communities do not provide value, but that they simply **have to take into account this change of context and reinvent/modernize themselves**.

I hope that sharing some of the **advice** I heard at the Open Space, and some of my own, will serve to **help refloat some communities and help new ones to emerge**.

> A book I really like that talks about adapting to change.: [Who Moved My Cheese?](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Spencer-Johnson/dp/0399144463/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=39BAFS7MV20R5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zoT19YfaR2b08zVkjZe2e0OGdTMvrcOsvxtxkGnEU8moy5ou07-LLppVg8nedZprast3hMhTFCJaue9jlJgmw6ZsGnYK7H_L4l-zmECV3z4vsCf3Kb_4qbqZocy25grVymjCcjGOP4h2gaGylJ11DaDG5sN6Kk6FN_eJhS3y2OgVl2kcp5Lpm4xt-0TcK40SOUV0_mJS9wcVA0Nv14Qo0yP1jiKp2qbjKGpntuuDnQY.9rIUivJpeFpsMntNHayamLjJElSNfNsjOGx_HRWO-qw&dib_tag=se&keywords=Who+took+my+cheese%3F&qid=1712813883&sprefix=who+took+my+cheese+%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1) üßÄüêÅ . As Albert Einstein said, "_The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results_."

## Anatomy of communities

And before I finish I wanted to share some ideas and resources to share my understanding of communities.

The most basic are the **degrees of involvement**. I used to explain them this way to my Esri colleagues several years ago (~2017):

After that, [Jorge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgebarrachina/) taught me several theories:  
* The *[Orbit Model](https://orbit.love/model)*, which serves as a model to explain that to increase the feeling of belonging to a group, it is necessary to increase the number of interactions and positive impacts between people, and that bonds are forged.
* The [1% rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule) I use to adjust expectations that no more than ~1% tend to help energize, nor ~10% participate, although really **measuring this is often quite subjective, just like trying to measure a friendship** (because at the end of the day, that's what they are).
* [The Community Maturity Model](https://communityroundtable.com/what-we-do/research/community-maturity-model/), an interesting framework for classifying different types of communities.
