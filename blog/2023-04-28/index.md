I have shared a new document (not 100% polished) where **I try to explain what problems anyone can better solve by learning new geospatial skills and tools**, including spatial databases, spatial analysis techniques, web mapping frameworks, geospatial libraries and APIs, spatial data formats, and spatial data visualization tools, GIS software, etc.

I group them into five big categories:

* [Geospatial algorithms.](/docs/geospatial/geo-developer-superpowers#geospatial-algorithms)
  * How to do spatial queries or operations.
  * How to do spatial calculations.
  * How to do network and topological analysis.
  * Geostatistical analysis.
  * Data transformations.
  * Georeferenced Image analysis (aerial, ground, satellite, ...).
* [Client-side development ](/docs/geospatial/geo-developer-superpowers#client-side-development)
  * Display 2D and 3D georeferenced data.
  * Create faster maps.
  * Customize / advance maps.
  * Interact with geospatial data.
  * Work with offline geospatial data.
  * Other.
* [Server-side development](/docs/geospatial/geo-developer-superpowers#server-side-development)
  * Design system architecture (how to store and access/integrate geospatial data).
  * Data capture/creation.
  * How to render 3D web animation as a video GPX track.
* [Data gathering and geolocation](/docs/geospatial/geo-developer-superpowers#data-gathering-and-geolocation)
	* Data gathering.
	* Data geolocation (georeferencing).
* [Map creation (not programmatically)](/docs/geospatial/geo-developer-superpowers#map-creation-not-programmatically).

Do you want to help me increase the list? [the document is on GitHub](https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/blob/master/docs/geospatial/geo-developer-superpowers.md) and [published under CC](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
