Are you reading about Artificial Intelligence again?? Seriously, wasn‚Äôt the 912,673,140 articles, news reports, podcasts, videos, or *reels*, and tiktoks out there enough? I love it, that means you're really into this topic üòúüòÇ.

The root of everything I‚Äôm going to share started with a proposal I received at the beginning of the school year from the guidance counselor at my children's school. She suggested that [the AMPA](https://www.ampanovaschoolalmeria.org/) collaborate with the school to organize an activity to educate students on AI usage. And since I‚Äôm easy to convince‚Ä¶ here I am, months later and many "brain cycles" later, sharing the progress.

In this article, I will talk about:
* **Traditional AI vs. Generative AI**: key differences.
* **Generative AI**: what makes it "special".
* **AI in education**: the current situation as I see it.
* **My contribution**: a new project I‚Äôve embarked on.
* **Protecting ourselves from the hype**: my advice to avoid falling for misinformation.

## Traditional vs. GenAI

As we know, AI is not new<sup>*</sup>. It has been used in search engines, recommendation engines (Netflix, social media, ...), virtual assistants (Google Home, Siri, Alexa, ...), automatic translators, facial recognition, spam filters, text predictors, CAPTCHAs, etc.

:::tip üß† Did you know...
The [Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence (AEPIA)](https://www.aepia.org/historia_aepia/) was founded in 1984?
:::

However, that doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that generative AI has arrived with incredible momentum, and it‚Äôs now ‚Äúeverywhere.‚Äù

The following table summarizes some key differences:

|Aspect|Traditional AI|Generative AI|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Analyze, predict, and/or classify|Create and generate "original" content|
|**Work model**|Based on specific rules|Contextual understanding-based|
|**Training data**|Structured and/or labeled data (by humans)|Large volumes of diverse data|
|**Tasks**|Solving specific problems|Creative and adaptive tasks|
|**Dependency on past data**|High, based on previous patterns|Lower, capable of innovating and creating new things|

## Generative AI

But why give it so much importance? What makes generative AI different from other disruptive technologies? Or as Bugs Bunny would say, [What's up, doc?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUuo3PhoXs0&ab_channel=ThemeSongGuy).

There have been many other technological advances that have had a radical impact on humanity and transformed us: the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, the Internet...

However, in recent years, we‚Äôve seen an increase in the speed at which these changes occur, likely due to globalization and new communication technologies.

The following chart from *Harvard Business Review* illustrates how the time needed to adopt new technologies has decreased over the years, based on data from the United States:

</figure>

Although I have not yet found highly reliable data on the adoption of generative AI tools, we‚Äôve heard that ChatGPT (launched in 2022) has already reached an incredible [300 million **weekly** active users](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313097/chatgpt-300-million-weekly-users).

To put this number into context, here‚Äôs a comparison showing other well-known applications and how long they took to reach 100 million **monthly** active users:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
  
  <img src="https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ChatGPT_A20Blockbuster_pages-to-jpg-0002-min.jpg?im=Resize,width=360,aspect=fit,type=normal)" />

  <figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-says-study-15840751.htm">CNBC TV18</a>, data provided by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarweb">Similar Web</a></figcaption>

</div>

For me, the importance isn‚Äôt just in the speed of adoption. What concerns me is that it is being used massively without a solid knowledge base, leading to content being generated and shared that appears to be high quality, but often are not.

Unlike widely used tools like Word or Excel, which require some training and come with an instruction manual, **most AI tools do not provide clear guidelines**.

Furthermore, they are so intuitive that anyone can enter a request and receive a response. However, what a new user might not realize is that if the request is not well defined, if they are unaware of the types of instructions AI can process, its limitations, biases, and other key characteristics, the chances of getting an inaccurate or misleading answer are significantly high.

And one of the biggest problems is that **there are still aspects of generative AI that even its own creators don‚Äôt fully understand**, such as how exactly prompts, meaning input instructions, influence responses.

Ultimately, this puts us in a situation where, [as Ram√≥n Beson√≠as says](https://youtu.be/KRIeyKi9bXw?si=Oz4YJDYZtQawecTI&t=137):
* **Everyone is a novice** when it comes to using AI (even its creators), with some of us having a few more months of experience than others.
* **There is still no clear methodology on how to teach AI.**

This is why I believe it is especially important for adults to gain a basic understanding, experiment with AI, and do their best to stay up to date‚Äîunderstanding how it can be used and sharing both good and bad experiences with others.

:::note We Live in Exponential Times
The first time I heard the phrase "we live in exponential times" was when I watched the video ["Did You Know" (2008)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL9Wu2kWwSY&ab_channel=AmybethQuinn). A quote that stuck with me was: "**We are preparing students for jobs that do not yet exist**," and these jobs will be highly demanded in just a few years. 

I couldn‚Äôt agree more. If this felt accurate to me back then, 17 years ago, it‚Äôs even clearer now that this exponential growth hasn‚Äôt slowed down. And maybe it‚Äôs just me, but at times, it‚Äôs almost dizzying.

## AI in Education

There are many debates around AI: intellectual property, ethics, regulation, job displacement... But what I take for granted is that this technology is here to stay, that **it is already redefining education and learning**, and that those who can use it correctly will have an advantage and stand out.

Did you know that according to [a survey by Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/29244/number-of-companies-using-open-ai-in-their-business-processes-worldwide/), the education sector could be the second most impacted by this technology? Below is an infographic with the results:

![](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/29244.jpeg)

But it‚Äôs not just educators using it‚Äî**students are also leveraging AI to do their work for them** (surprise!! üòú).

But you know what? I don‚Äôt blame them. One of AI‚Äôs promises is that it helps us with tasks we don‚Äôt like or find less important. And I think that, deep down, even if we don‚Äôt admit it, many adults started using AI for the same reason.

The biggest issue I‚Äôve encountered, however, is that even if you try to find it, **there is no good content**<sup>*</sup> to guide how AI should be used **for studying**‚Äîmeaning content that is accessible, comprehensive, structured, high-quality, and free.

:::note
Or at least I haven‚Äôt found it. I‚Äôm looking for resources that explain how to use AI correctly for studying, developing new skills, improving cognitive development, strengthening critical thinking, boosting creativity, increasing productivity... If you know of any, please leave them in [the comments](#comments) üôèüòä.
:::

It‚Äôs becoming increasingly clear that **we will need to develop new skills**.

Just as the advent of computing, the Internet, and search engines required us to develop new skills‚Äîsuch as knowing how to search online‚Äînow, it will be more important than ever to enhance other competencies, such as language skills and critical thinking, to make good use of generative AI.

For example, we will need to understand the differences between various AI tools and models at a high level or learn how to craft effective prompts to get useful results.

And while I hope this won‚Äôt happen, if we don‚Äôt develop these skills, I fear society could face a [dystopian](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/dystopia_n?tl=true) future where new generations are less prepared and surrounded by misinformation that is difficult to identify.

That‚Äôs why **we must use this technology as just another tool** to assist us in our work and skill development‚Äînot misuse it in a way that hinders our growth and intelligence.

Repeatedly, it‚Äôs clear that AI, like anything else, can do great things if used well, but it can also create problems if misused.

I agree with Ram√≥n Beson√≠as that ideally, most of the times you should score between 70% and 90%.

## My Contribution

You might be wondering, after all this discussion, what am I doing to address this issue?

Beyond doing my best to educate my children at home and support their school, I‚Äôve embarked on a new documentation project in the section "[My Digital Brain > Artificial Intelligence](/docs/digital-brain)."

Since I‚Äôm neither a teacher nor an AI expert, I‚Äôve reached out for help through interviews with [teachers in Spain, AI specialists, and experts in related fields](https://www-rauljimenez-info.translate.goog/es/docs/artificial-intelligence/education-ai?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp#agradecimientos) to gather information on this topic: ideas, experiences, resources, insights, etc.

:::note
If you know someone who I should definitely interview, please ask her/him to reach out to me through [any of my channels](/).
:::

The goal is to create educational material that fills the gap I found. Content on how to use AI (for students) with a holistic approach that is accessible, structured, comprehensive, high-quality, and free. I hope this resource will not only support the activities we are organizing at our Parents' Association but also be useful for other educational communities.

For now, just can find the working doc in Spanish: [Using AI in Education](https://www.rauljimenez.info/es/docs/artificial-intelligence/education-ai#agradecimientos), but I encourage you to check the following resource:

<Button label="Using AI in Education (Google's translated version)" link="https://www-rauljimenez-info.translate.goog/es/docs/artificial-intelligence/education-ai?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp" block />

## Protect Yourself from the "Hype"

We can't deny that although AI has great potential, the "[hype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle)" surrounding it is overwhelming.

Every technological innovation brings this effect, as shown in the following graph, which you can find in all "*Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies*" reports:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>

<figure>

   alt="Hype cycle" />
 <figcaption>Hype cycle, Image by Jeremykemp, Wikipedia</figcaption>
</figure>

</div>

But let‚Äôs not forget why this happens. It‚Äôs a mix of:
* The optimism and passion of some innovators.
* The eagerness of many people to believe in it.
* The vast media attention and publicity.
* The "hidden" (economic) interests of the companies behind these innovations, competing non-stop to lead these revolutions.

This often leads to inflated expectations, sometimes at the cost of spreading misleading information. 

To protect yourself from manipulation and misinformation, not just about AI, I recommend:

1. **Be wary of emotional language:** Anything that sounds too good to be true, exaggerated promises, or alarmist headlines. These are usually signs of manipulation. By the way, this applies to everything.
2. **Be critical:** Evaluate the source of the information and check for economic interests.
3. **Do your research:** Look for expert opinions and reliable sources.
4. **Diversify your sources:** Consult multiple perspectives for a more complete view.

:::tip Who Has Economic Interests?
**Companies**. The biggest stakeholders are the companies providing the technology driving this innovation, such as OpenAI, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon (AWS), Meta, etc. These publicly traded companies need to maintain and increase their stock value, and many do so by making announcements that fuel the "hype."

**Content creators** who make money through ads or affiliate links, like news media, YouTubers, Instagram influencers, TikTokers, etc.
