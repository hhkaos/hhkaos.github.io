In this first article of the series "[History of technical communities](../2024-07-05/index.md)," we will review the history of technical communities in Spain, before the Internet, during the era when computing arrived and the revolution of [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_personal_computers) began.

## Previous context

Let's review some facts from the national and international context to set the stage.

### United States

1975 is the year when the United States ended the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War).

[IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM) was already 64 years old, the giant and world leader in manufacturing computers ([mainframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer)) used by companies, government institutions, and academia.

By this time, some of the first [user groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Users%27_group) or communities I could find were already a few years old, such as:

- [TMRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club), MIT students related to hacking culture (1946).
- [SHARE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing)), IBM mainframe user group (1955).
- [GUIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUIDE_International), an IBM systems user group (1956).
- [DECUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECUS), the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) computer user group (1961).

In 1963, the [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers) was created, a non-profit organization that would later create standards such as [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3) (1983), [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11) (1997), etc.

By then, some notable computing conferences that brought together technical profiles had already been held, such as the [International Solid-State Circuits Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Solid-State_Circuits_Conference) (1954) and the [Symposium on Operating Systems Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_on_Operating_Systems_Principles) (1967).

On the other hand, Intel, already 7 years old, launched the first microprocessor in 1971, the [Intel 4004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004) (at a cost of $450, as of 2023), which would revolutionize the personal computer industry.

### Spain

Now let's review some important facts related to computing in Spain before the dictator [Francisco Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco) died in 1975 after 36 years in power.

Up to that date, the most notable figure in the sector I have found is [Jos√© Garc√≠a Santesmases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Garc%C3%ADa_Santesmases), a physicist and pioneer of computing in Spain who was 68 years old that year. He:

- Created the Institute of Electricity and Automation (1952).
- Organized an [international automation congress](https://web.archive.org/web/20140607041251/https://www.scie.es/historia-progreso-informatica-cientifica-universitaria-espana/congresos-informatica-cientifica-universitaria/) (1958).
- Created the Spanish Association of Computing and Automation (AEIA) (1967).
- Organized the [First National Congress of Automation](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (1970).
    
It was also before Franco's death that the [Association of Computing Technicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Engineers_Association_of_Spain) (1967) and the [Institute of Computing](https://www.fi.upm.es/web/historia/institutodeinformatica/) under the Ministry of Education and Science (1969) were created.

In 1971, an order (law) was approved in Spain, and that would establish the study plans for [the different degrees](https://www.cpitia.org/el-colegio/ingenieria-tecnica-informatica/historia/), which shortly afterwards would give rise to the first Faculties of Computer Science.

## The Spanish transition

The same year Franco died, in the United States, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) and launched what is considered the first personal computer that was well-received by the market (in terms of performance/price ratio), the [Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800).

In this year (1975), the mythical [Homebrew Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club) was also founded, where Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs showed their [Apple 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I) in 1976, a moment ‚Äúimmortalized‚Äù in movies like [Pirates of Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley) ([see sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxthr3fq-EI)) or [Jobs (2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs_(film)).

In 1976, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne founded [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.), and launched the [Apple-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I). The same year Bill Gates wrote his famous letter ‚Äú[An Open Letter to Hobbyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists)‚Äù.

:::note
The first film documenting the Apple-Microsoft rivalry, [Pirates of Silicon Valley](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley), was not released until 1999.

That year was when the first Computer Sciences Faculties were created in Spain at the Polytechnic Universities of Madrid and Barcelona, and the University of Valladolid ([see more](https://www.cpitia.org/el-colegio/ingenieria-tecnica-informatica/historia/#:~:text=El%20Decreto%20593%2F1976%2C%20de,su%20centro%20de%20San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n.)).

## First associations

On June 15, 1977, the first democratic elections were held in Spain.

Shortly after, the **[Constitution of Spain (1978)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Spain)** was approved, which among many other things **includes the right to [freedom of association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association)**, which would promote the formation of many associations in Spain from which articles, manuals, and case studies would be published.

Some of these associations are:

- üá™üá∏ [Association of Graduates in Computing Engineering](https://www.ali.es/presentacion/) (1980).
- üá™üá∏ [Spanish Association for Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis](https://www.aerfai.org/) (1982).
- üá™üá∏ [Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aepia.org/historia_aepia/) (1983).
- üá™üá∏ [Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing](http://www.sepln.org/) (1984).
- üá™üá∏ [Ada Spain Association](http://www.adaspain.org/) (1987).
- üá™üá∏ [Association for the Development of Educational Computing](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (1989).

In parallel, outside Spain, other notable groups were formed:
- üá©üá™ [Chaos Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club), a hackers association (1981).
- üá∫üá∏ [Macintosh User Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_User_Group) (1984).
- üá∫üá∏ [Apple User Group Connection (AUGC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_User_Group_Connection) (1985), [promotional video from 1991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkvtERqJnp0).

## First online communities
Also, around this time (early 80s), the first online communities could be said to emerge, gathering around bulletin board systems ([BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system)), the precursors to today's forums.

Almost in parallel, [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) emerged (~1980), another system for exchanging opinions and experiences. This is the system [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#GNU_project) used in 1983 to announce his plan for the [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) operating system. Two years later, in 1985, he founded the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation), whose philosophy would have a significant impact on the world of software and soon after on hardware, and of course around many technical communities.

Shortly after Usenet, in the year when [Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext) was being experimented with in Spain and we could listen to Michael Jackson's recently released Thriller on the [walkmans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman) (1982), Telef√≥nica began marketing [Minitel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel), a system that could be used to access the phone book, retail shopping, access company information services, databases, forums, and messaging.

In that same year (1982), [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) was founded, where in 1991 they would start working on the project that would result in the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) language.

In 1984, [FidoNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet) emerged, a popular network of BBS nodes that would gain traction in Spain and for the first time allow many strangers to communicate worldwide via computers over telephone lines. For example, the node "2:345/801" was the address of a board called ‚Äú[Atlantis](https://groups.google.com/g/soc.culture.spain/c/jGLymQIac3I)‚Äù whose operator was Alfredo Sanchez, from Granada, and whose phone number was ‚Äú958132748‚Äù. More information in "[Traveling in time: SysOp of a BBS in 1997 and Fidonet in Spain](https://carrero.es/sysop-de-una-bbs-fidonet-1997/)". Here is another list of [nodes from 1987](http://www.textfiles.com/fidonet-on-the-internet/n1987/nodelist.289), and here are [other nodes from Spain](https://www.cyberiada.org/r34.htm).

## Conferences

In the national scene, most of the technical conferences and events held were more from the university sector:
- üá™üá∏ [Automation Days](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comit%C3%A9_Espa%C3%B1ol_de_Autom%C3%A1tica) of the Spanish Automation Committee (1977).
- üá™üá∏ [IV National Congress of Computing and Automation](https://www.ceautomatica.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/50-ANIVERSARIO-DEL-CEA_1967-2017.pdf) (AEIA) (1979).
- üá™üá∏ [V Congress of Computing and Automation](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (AEIA) (1982).
- üá™üá∏ [Congress of the Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aepia.org/caepia/) (1985).
- üá™üá∏ [VI Congress of Computing and Automation](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (AEIA) (1985).

And in the United States, here are some that seemed interesting to highlight:
- üá∫üá∏ [History of Programming Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Programming_Languages_(conference)) (1978)
- üá∫üá∏ [IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Symposium_on_Security_and_Privacy) (1980)
- üá∫üá∏ [Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference) (WWDC) (1983)

## PCs and video games

Throughout this decade (the 80s), [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386) (1985) and [486](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I486) (1989) computers arrived in many Spanish homes, and video game consoles began to flood houses: [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) (1982), [Nintendo NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) (1983), [Sega SG-1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG-1000) (1983) [Amstrad CPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) (1984), [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) (1985), [Atari 7800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_7800) (1986), [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) (1989), ... In this climate, the first meeting called the [Game Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Developers_Conference) was organized in 1988, in California, with about 20 people that would grow to about 125 the following year, and today gathers nearly 28,000 people.

## End of the era

Other relevant events at the end of this era:

- [RedIRIS](https://www.rediris.es/rediris/historia/index.html.es) (1988) emerged in Spain, the Interconnection Network of Computing Resources for universities and research centers.
- [Guy Kawasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki) created a team of evangelists at Apple.
- The popular [Concurrent Versions System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) (CVS) was born (1990).
- Also in 1990, Open Design Circuits proposed the creation of a hardware design community with the spirit of free software ([more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware)).
- Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger introduced the concept of ‚Äú[Community of Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice)‚Äù that accompanies us to this day and is defined as: ‚Äúa group of people who share an interest, deepen their knowledge and experience in the area through continuous interaction that strengthens their relationships‚Äù (1991).

Finally, what would change society and the community ecosystem in the coming years was presented by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) in 1991, the foundations of the World Wide Web.

## Conclusions

As we have observed, during this era, computing arrived in Spain, along with the constitution and the first associations, which emerged around the scientific and university community.

- The first computing, automation, and artificial intelligence conferences were held. At the same time, BBS and Usenet emerged, where the first more informal online communities began to form.
- Internationally, the first user groups and computer hobbyist clubs emerged around electronics, specific company systems, hacking... along with some conferences that were mainly face-to-face.

**In summary, these groups and conferences talked about**: operating systems, automation, robotics, circuits, programming languages, artificial intelligence, IBM systems, Apple, video games, networks, and security.

Based on this information, I would say that when we talked about community in Spain at this time, we mainly referred to: a group of people who meet in person on their own initiative and share an interest in software, whose goal is professional development. Mainly to publish articles, manuals, and case studies.

And you, what do you think?

If you liked it... I will soon publish the next article in the series: ‚Äú1992-2003: The Rise of Online Communities.‚Äù
