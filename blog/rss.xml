produced last year after the Open Space (🇪🇸)</a> <strong>with help from several people</strong>, I have published three resources:</p><ul><li><a

"<em>placeholders</em>" on resources that I hope to develop based on input from the upcoming Open Space<sup>(1)</sup>:</p><ul><li><a href="/docs/communities/how-to-finance-communities">📄 How to finance communities</a></li><li><a href="/docs/communities/how-to-encourage-other-people-to-energize">📄 How do you encourage others to energize</a></li><li><a

"<strong>How to sustain technical communities</strong>" that <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-rey-rey-9022702a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dani Rey</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oskarcalvo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oskar Calvo</a> and I have proposed will take place, which will be "the continuation" of last year's Open Space where some of the challenges facing technical communities were discussed.</p></blockquote><p>At the end <strong><a href="#contributions">I have added a list of people who have contributed</a></strong> to this work. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="communities-in-recess">Communities in recess?<a href="#communities-in-recess" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Communities in recess?" title="Direct link to Communities in recess?">​</a></h2><p>Are the communities in recess, are the communities having more problems now than before?</p><p>After talking to many people, and in different forums, such as Open Space, my perception is that there is a general feeling about the <strong>drop of activity in many of the technology communities</strong> (both in Spain and abroad) <strong>in the last few years</strong>, especially since the pandemic.</p><p>By "drop of activity" I mean a mix of things, but mainly I mean a lower attendance to meetings (face-to-face and online), interactions in mailing lists/IMs, etc.</p><p>And this situation, as is normal, worries those of us who energize communities.</p><p>One of the concerns that I have heard recurrently is that the average age of the people who are part of these communities is growing, or what is the same, that <strong>it is difficult to attract and engage the new generations</strong>. </p><p>Personally, I am reluctant to believe that this is because the experience offered by the communities no longer provides as much value to the new generations as other new formats, channels or "forums". </p><p>But before we continue... what is a community?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-community">What is a community?<a href="#what-is-a-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is a community?" title="Direct link to What is a community?">​</a></h2><p>Or rather, <strong>what do I mean by community, or technology community</strong>?</p><p>Perhaps it is good to start with this question, since for example, during the Commit Open Space, in my opinion, there were times when the conversation revolved around different concepts of "community". </p><div style="text-align:center"><figure><p><a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/user-group-meetup-tech-community-df0ffb3c94116a56f31d01a6508eb7b5.png"><img loading="lazy" alt="Vibrant meeting space, technologists gather with faces animated by enthusiasm." src="/assets/images/user-group-meetup-tech-community-df0ffb3c94116a56f31d01a6508eb7b5.png" width="1431" height="977" class="img_ev3q"></a></p></figure></div><p>In my case, I talk about what is known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">communities of practice</a>", which in short are <strong>groups of people</strong>(user groups, associations, meetups...) that:</p><ul><li><strong>organize regular meetings</strong> (face-to-face and/or online).</li><li><strong>share a passion / profession / concerns, ... for technology</strong> (software, hardware, methodologies or best practices, ...).</li><li>mainly, <strong>seek to collaborate with each other, voluntarily and altruistically</strong>.</li><li>they <strong>seek the common benefit</strong> above the particular one (including the particular interest of the organizations that may support/sponsor them).</li><li>are <strong>always open to new people</strong>.</li><li>feel part of the group and identify with it.</li></ul><p>So, I just wanted to clarify that:</p><ol><li>This is in my experience and is based primarily on the type of communities I just described. </li><li>I believe that most of the ideas and tips shared in <a href="/docs/category/-tech-communities">the documents</a>, can be applied to this type of communities, whether they are local (in small and in big cities), as much as online/virtual, regardless of the fact that each one has its peculiarities.</li></ol><p>Having said all of the above, it does not detract from the fact that some of <strong>the tips can also be applied to people who are in the business of disseminating online content, or people who organize large conferences</strong>. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-has-changed">What has changed?<a href="#what-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What has changed?" title="Direct link to What has changed?">​</a></h2><p>Why do those of us who have been energizing communities have this feeling/perception?</p><p>To give some context, I started to get involved with this particular type of communities at the university (in ~2009), and since then <a href="https://www.rauljimenez.info/docs/about-me/open-culture#communities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I have participated, contributed, founded and co-organized quite a few communities</a>, organizing hundreds of meetings (of all kinds).</p><p>Based on this experience, I would say that the feeling that activity is declining is mainly due to the fact that <strong>it is harder for us to provide value</strong> as we did before.</p><p>Now the offer is wider and the attention is diversifying with the increase of communities, channels/media (Discords, Slacks, RRSS, ...), but also the rise of <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/828546487369990144/members" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">influencers</a>. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The image shows a cluttered room, a person hiding behind his hands, drowned between screens and cables." src="/assets/images/information-saturation-noise-social-networks-7b603328b4a82f731ca577435990306f.png" width="794" height="544" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Personally I also think that digital contact is eating more ground to the physical, just see that <strong>almost everything is done through apps</strong>: order food, a cab, talk / chat, procedures with the administration, ... even flirting! 😅 and I have no doubt that this also has consequences. </p><p>That is why I believe that it is not that communities do not provide value, but that they simply <strong>have to take into account this change of context and reinvent/modernize themselves</strong>.</p><p>I hope that sharing some of the <strong>advice</strong> I heard at the Open Space, and some of my own, will serve to <strong>help refloat some communities and help new ones to emerge</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>A book I really like that talks about adapting to change.: <a

I used to explain them this way to my Esri colleagues several years ago (~2017):</p><div style="text-align:center"><figure><p><a target="_blank"

community.</figcaption></figure></div><p>After that, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgebarrachina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jorge</a> taught me several theories:  </p><ul><li>The <em><a href="https://orbit.love/model" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbit Model</a></em>, which serves as a model to explain that to increase the feeling of belonging to a group, it is necessary to increase the number of interactions and positive impacts between people, and that bonds are forged.</li><li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1% rule</a> I use to adjust expectations that no more than ~1% tend to help energize, nor ~10% participate, although really <strong>measuring this is often quite subjective, just like trying to measure a friendship</strong> (because at the end of the day, that's what they are).</li><li><a

It is one of the largest <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1571289000886910977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">events for developers that is held annually in Spain</a>. It is well attended and draws strong participation from around 50 Spanish technical communities.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of the venue&amp;#39;s lobby during event registration" src="/assets/images/commitconf23-checkin-37cb452971ff608dc49a74037b42e271.jpg" width="826" height="223" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-attend-conferences-like-commitconf">Why attend conferences like CommitConf?<a href="#why-attend-conferences-like-commitconf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why attend conferences like CommitConf?" title="Direct link to Why attend conferences like CommitConf?">​</a></h2><p>At the conference, developers were brought together to <strong>retrain, discover, and share new insight and knowledge about our profession</strong>. For example, attendees shared information about:</p><ul><li>New tools and languages.</li><li>New capabilities for the tools and languages already used by the community.</li><li>How companies solve different software development challenges.</li><li>Best practices in accessibility, security, and design patterns.</li><li>New trends.</li></ul><p>Additionally, the conference provided a place to meet new people and reconnect with those already known. At events like this, it’s not uncommon to run into people you know! In my case, I bumped into some of my former colleagues, and some developers who use <strong><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArcGIS to create Location-Aware apps or map applications</a></strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Selfies taken by Raul with other developers during the event." src="/assets/images/commitconf23-developers-71f22a5a9c02eb7cd3bde91682ab0aea.jpg" width="826" height="194" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-made-this-conference-special">What made this conference special?<a href="#what-made-this-conference-special" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What made this conference special?" title="Direct link to What made this conference special?">​</a></h2><p>This event, like many others, gives us, developers, the opportunity to <strong>present talks, workshops, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Spaces</a></strong>.</p><p>For attendees, a unique factor that sets this event apart from others is the system used to create the event‘s agenda, <strong>allowing the communities themselves to be involved in the selection process of talks</strong>.

I had the opportunity to share tips and ideas to overcome challenges in creating and maintaining developer communities with approximately thirty other people. Among them were representatives from different communities about Python, Software Crafting, Data, Machine Learning, generalists’ communities, Free Software, GNU/Linux, DevOps, Drupal, and us representing the <a href="https://meetup.com/es-ES/geo-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoDevelopers community</a>.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: After the session, I decided to create a guide with what we learned and our own experience. If you are interested, save the article in favourites because we will add it <strong>[here]</strong> in a few weeks.</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of the Open Space on communities showing about thirty attendees seated in a circle." src="/assets/images/commitcont23-openspace-600b7ea1816f53041aa3830da01b7a17.jpg" width="826" height="463" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li><p><strong>Detecting Web Performance Issues with Chrome DevTools</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/nucliweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@nucliweb</a> gave an overview of the Chrome DevTools and showed us how they keep adding new tools like <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/recorder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recorder</a> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coverage</a> to help evaluate your web performance and optimize it. Also, he showed us how the new AVIF image format improves WebP performance. More info at <a href="https://web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web.dev</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t Yell at Me, I Can’t See You</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/javierabadia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@javierabadia</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jameshedaweng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@jameshedaweng</a> explained to us how to divide the responsibilities between an Engineering Manager and a Product Manager to avoid failure when creating a product. In summary, a PM must be responsible for <em>what</em> features to add and <em>why</em>, and the EM in the <em>how</em> and the <em>who</em>. The <em>when</em> should be a shared responsibility.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why I Decided to Pursue the Developer Relations Path</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/kinisoftware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@kinisoftware</a> told us about his experience as a Staff Developer Relations Engineer, where he works to promote the expertise of Criteo’s technical team by facilitating participation in events and communities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing Web Accessibility</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/bolonio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@bolonio</a> showed us a multitude of tools and resources for testing web accessibility: <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe-core</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jest-axe</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe-core/cli</a>, <a href="https://pa11y.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pa11y</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pa11y-ci</a>, <a href="http://deque.com/axe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe chrome extension</a>, <a href="http://paciellogroup.com/toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arc toolkit</a>, <a href="http://accessibilityinsights.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessibilityinsights.io</a>, <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wave.webaim.org</a>, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Mistake of Becoming a Manager</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/npatarino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@npatarino</a> explained to us that becoming a manager of people is not the only way to have leadership or increase your salary. He said that for those senior software engineers who want to continue growing, there are other positions such as Staff Software Engineer, Principal Software Engineer, Distinguished Software Engineer and Technical Fellow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Past, Present and Future of EducaMadrid</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/asanzdiego" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@asanzdiego</a> talked to us about the educational platform of the Community of Madrid that he leads; he told us about the technical challenges they suffered during the pandemic, when the number of active users grew exponentially, along with the strengths and limitations of his team and his technological stack based on free software.</p></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Composition of photographs of different sessions attended by Raul." src="/assets/images/commitconf23-techsessions-719b97091a6fcea3d34f9e95f9e53268.jpg" width="826" height="402" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In summary, if you don't use to go to developer conferences, <strong>I hope my experience has encouraged you and given you arguments to attend in the future</strong>. I would say also to the <strong><a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esri Developer Summit in the USA</a></strong> (or <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit-europe/save-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in Europe</a>), although this rather applies if you are an Esri partner or customer 😉.</p><p>Remember, <strong>although much of the content of these conferences is then made available online, there are many other things that can only be achieved by attending.</strong></p><blockquote><p>If you want to leave comments, you can do it in <a href="https://dev.to/hhkaos/why-attend-developer-conferences-59b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the article published in Dev.to</a></p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

Os dejo otro par de plataformas con MOOCs que siguen esta línea donde podréis encontrar cursos gratuitos (con certificaciones de pago):&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://coursera.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coursera</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://miriadax.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miriadax</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeAcademy</a>&nbsp;y&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EDX</a>&nbsp;(<em>gracias Pino por esta última!</em>).</p><p>Bueno, pues en mi caso pago una cuota de&nbsp;<strong>25 dólares al mes</strong>&nbsp;en Codeschool, lo que en estos meses (con descuentos incluidos) han sido unos 125€ y aunque pueda parecer una cantidad considerable, creo que si analizamos lo que he adquirido a cambio le da otra perspectiva diferente.</p><p>Por ejemplo, yo en este tiempo&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/users/227734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he hecho 9</a>&nbsp;de los 36 cursos que tienen disponibles:</p><p>–&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javascript Road Trip Part 1</a>&nbsp;<strong>(Gratuito)</strong><br>
