It was one of its printers that in 1980 would give rise to the anecdote that would eventually lead Richard Stallman to the creation of the Free Software Foundation.</p><p>Until recently, software was not perceived as a product. It was when IBM decided to unbundle it from hardware (in 1969) that the independent software vendor industry (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_software_vendor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISVs</a>) was born, where companies such as Microsoft would soon play a fundamental role.</p><p>By this time, some of the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Users%27_group" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user groups</a> or communities I could find were already a few years old, such as:</p><ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TMRC</a>, MIT students related to hacking culture (1946).</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SHARE</a>, IBM mainframe user group (1955).</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUIDE_International" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GUIDE</a>, an IBM systems user group (1956).</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECUS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DECUS</a>, the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) computer user group (1961).</li></ul><p>In 1963, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IEEE</a> was created, a non-profit organization that would later create standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethernet</a> (1983), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wi-Fi</a> (1997), etc.</p><p>By then, some notable computing conferences that brought together technical profiles had already been held, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Solid-State_Circuits_Conference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Solid-State Circuits Conference</a> (1954) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_on_Operating_Systems_Principles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symposium on Operating Systems Principles</a> (1967).</p><p>On the other hand, Intel, already 7 years old, launched the first microprocessor in 1971, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intel 4004</a> (at a cost of $450, as of 2023), which would revolutionize the personal computer industry.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spain">Spain<a href="#spain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spain" title="Direct link to Spain">‚Äã</a></h3><p>Now let's review some important facts related to computing in Spain before the dictator <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Francisco Franco</a> died in 1975 after 36 years in power.</p><p>Up to that date, the most notable figure in the sector I have found is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Garc%C3%ADa_Santesmases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jos√© Garc√≠a Santesmases</a>, a physicist and pioneer of computing in Spain who was 68 years old that year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, I write this article motivated by a <a href="https://blog-commit--conf-com.translate.goog/meetups-sobre-dinamizacion-de-comunidades/?_x_tr_sl=es&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new community initiative</a> that we are starting and still doesn‚Äôt have a name. It is mainly aimed at people with experience or the intention to create technical communities, with the purpose of <strong>helping to create healthier, more attractive, useful, and sustainable communities</strong>.</p><p>In this context, I find myself needing to define what a technical community is, at least for me.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="an-ambiguous-term">An ambiguous term<a href="#an-ambiguous-term" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to An ambiguous term" title="Direct link to An ambiguous term">‚Äã</a></h2><p>To begin with, I hope everyone agrees with me that the term <em><a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community</a></em> not only has many meanings and synonyms, but it has been used to refer to many things, sometimes more accurately and sometimes less so, making it very ambiguous.</p><p>For example, when we talk about a community, we could be referring to a multitude of things (at least in Spanish):</p><ul><li>A <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/collective" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">collective</a> </li><li>A <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/gremio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">guild</a></li><li>A <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/group?m=form" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">group</a> (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mutual aid group</a>, group of users/customers, ...)</li><li>A <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/club?m=form" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">club</a> (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_discussion_club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">book discussion club</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_club" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fan club</a></li><li>A <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tribu?m=form"

Fellowship of the Ring</a> üíçüòÇ</li><li>...</li></ul><p>In the tech world, the term has been used, and we could even say... abused or misused to the point where some of us feel that the romantic meaning of the word has been distorted.</p><p>Here are some illustrative examples in different contexts:</p><ul><li><strong>The community of a technology</strong> <br>(e.g., <a href="https://www.python.org/community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python community</a>, <a href="https://dev.java/community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Java community</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android community</a>, ‚Ä¶)</li><li><strong>The community of a platform</strong> <br> (e.g., <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub community</a>, <a href="https://meetups.twitch.tv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch community</a>, <a href="https://investor.redditinc.com/overview/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit community</a>, Stack

rel="noopener noreferrer">OSM</a>, <a href="https://codely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodelyTV</a>...)</li><li><strong>The internal community (of employees) of a brand or

href="https://github.com/mouredev/Monthly-App-Challenge-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mouredev</a>, ...)</li><li><strong>The community of a movement, practice, or methodology</strong> <br> (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/open-source" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open source community</a>, <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/communities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Agile community</a>, ...)</li><li><strong>The community of an event/conference</strong> <br> (e.g., <a href="https://community-es.codemotion.it/comunidad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Codemotion</a>, ...)</li><li><strong>The community of a field or guild</strong> <br> (e.g., Frontend, Backend, DevOps, ...)</li><li>...</li></ul><p>This often leads to debates about what we generally mean by community in the tech world.</p><p>Keep in mind that language evolves over time, and the use of words is closely linked to the context in which they are expressed. To dig a bit more into this, I‚Äôve decided to start a series of articles on the <a href="/blog/history-of-technical-communities">History of technical communities (in Spain)</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-definition">My definition<a href="#my-definition" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My definition" title="Direct link to My definition">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Here‚Äôs what I understand by technical community, in the most traditional/romantic sense, heavily influenced by <a href="https://www.rauljimenez.info/es/docs/about-me/open-culture#communities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my own life experience</a>, and clearly biased:</p><p>It is a <strong>group of people</strong> who:</p><ul><li>Emerge from <strong>their own initiative</strong> (<a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimiento_de_bases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grassroots movement</a>).</li><li><strong>Share an interest in technology</strong> (software or hardware), for example: programming languages, methodologies, cybersecurity, data, or robotics.</li><li><strong>Are governed by a set of norms</strong> or rules, whether implicit or explicit (like a code of conduct, decalogue, nettiquete, ...) and <strong>defined by the community itself</strong>.</li><li>Have a <strong>purpose</strong> or goal more focused on <strong>professional or personal development</strong> rather than pure entertainment.</li></ul><p>Where all these people, both promoters and other participants, voluntarily decide to invest part of their <strong>free time</strong> (out of intrinsic motivation), and sometimes money, to interact regularly with each other. Sometimes without expecting anything more than the satisfaction of helping others, sharing knowledge, sharing experiences, learning from others, collaborating on projects, and ultimately <strong>enjoying with like-minded people their passion for technology in their free time</strong>.</p><p>Always <strong>altruistically</strong>, and even seeking the good of others at their own expense, often leading to the <strong>formation of strong bonds</strong>.</p><p>If I had to name some communities that I think would fit quite well, they would be:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.microsiervos.com/archivo/hackers/hispahack.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">!Hispahack</a></li><li><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispalinux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hispalinux</a></li><li><a href="https://es.python.org/comunidades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local Python communities</a></li><li><a href="https://www.hotosm.org/community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HOT communities</a></li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>That said, I must say that:</p><ul><li>This definition probably does not apply to more than 90% of the communities that exist today.</li><li>Nor does it mean I do not appreciate or admire other types of communities.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-controversy">The controversy<a href="#the-controversy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The controversy" title="Direct link to The controversy">‚Äã</a></h2><p>The other day, thinking about some classic debates where people from the same generation discussed whether ‚ÄúX‚Äù was a community or not, I remembered when my father used to tell me: ‚Äú<em>what you‚Äôre listening to isn‚Äôt music, it‚Äôs noise!</em>‚Äù Does that sound familiar? Personally, I think it‚Äôs natural that as we get older, we hang on to our memories and nostalgia for something, and it‚Äôs hard for us to accept that things change and evolve into something that we may or may not like.</p><p>And more often than I‚Äôd like, I find myself in similar debates: is an online community a real community? Is the community of a company a community? Is the community of X a community?, ...</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-really-matters">What really matters<a href="#what-really-matters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What really matters" title="Direct link to What really matters">‚Äã</a></h2><p>But I wonder, how important is the label we put on it?</p><p>My opinion is quite firm on this. I say that, as always, the most important thing is to seek what unites us and not what separates us. We are already in a sufficiently divided, confrontational, and polarized society, to add more fuel to the fire over things that, in my opinion... are <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trivialities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trivialities</a>.</p><p>Just like people, communities are diverse; you may like them more or less, and everyone will judge which people and communities they like better, seem healthier, or toxic, but in any case, what I say is... let‚Äôs try to empathize, always act with respect, sincerity, honesty, and as far as possible... collaborate.</p><p>In my opinion, this is the antidote to most problems.</p><p>And you, what do you think?</p>]]></content:encoded>

So, with the idea of helping him improve them, I start asking him questions, to see if I can understand the plot better, but still <strong>I'm missing characters, or clarifications, or anything else</strong> that makes it hard for me to understand the story.</p><p>In the end, both his mother and I decided that the best thing would be for <strong>one of us to also read the book</strong>, so we could help him because otherwise, how would we know if he had missed something important or not?</p><p>Well... something that initially didn't seem complicated, I realized was more difficult than I thought üòÖ.</p><p>One of the things I have noticed while reading the books is that <strong>every one or two pages, there are words that I suspect he doesn't know</strong>, like <em>exhalation</em>, <em>arrogant</em>, <em>seep</em>, <em>utopian</em>, <em>electoral campaign</em>, ..., so every time I read one of his books, I ask him to verify. </p><p>Indeed, many he doesn't know, and I always tell him:</p><blockquote><p><em>Jos√©, when you don't understand something...ask what it means! Because if you don't, you're probably not understanding the story well.</em></p></blockquote><p>I always do it... even when I'm reading <a href="https://www.amazon.es/Libros-Mikecrack/s?rh=n%3A599364031%2Cp_27%3AMikecrack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mikecrack</a> stories to him and his brother in bed before sleeping, but no matter how much I repeat it... there comes a time when he stops asking.</p><p>But well, once the entire book is read and all the vocabulary is reviewed, we move on to the summary. There, my method consists of reminding him that every story has:</p><ul><li>A <strong>beginning</strong>, where something usually happens that disrupts the order and:<ol><li>Creates a problem to solve.</li><li>Is the trigger for an adventure.</li></ol></li><li>Then there's the <strong>development</strong> (or middle), which is what is told in most of the book.</li><li>Then there's an <strong>end</strong> (or conclusion), where the situation is resolved, or the story ends, and everything returns to normal.</li><li>And besides this, there are some <strong>characters</strong> more important than others, without whom the story could not be told well.</li></ul><p>And then I ask him to, using those four elements, tell me what happens at the beginning, the most important things that happen before reaching the end, how everything is resolved and returns to normal, and while doing that, explain who each of the characters are.</p><p>Well, as you can imagine, despite all attempts and trying to give him hints, because to be honest, <strong>even I sometimes find it hard to summarize</strong>... I can't get the summary to meet my expectations üòÖ, which ends in my frustration üò°, for which I then have to apologize to him, explaining that it is not his fault but my own frustration for not being able to help him üòû.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="asking-for-help-from-the-teacher">Asking for help from the teacher<a href="#asking-for-help-from-the-teacher" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Asking for help from the teacher" title="Direct link to Asking for help from the teacher">‚Äã</a></h2><p>So I said to myself, "<em>OK Ra√∫l, you're not doing it right, ask the teacher for help!</em>" (and that's what I did).</p><p>After talking to her, she gave me some advice. Since the books are quite long, she told me to ask Jos√© to <strong>write down "the main ideas" of each chapter on a separate sheet</strong>, and then with all of them, make the summary.</p><p>Here are the notes we made from the book <a href="https://www.amazon.es/Anna-Kadabra-13-Peligro-mansi%C3%B3n/dp/8408282468/ref=sr_1_1?crid=R7EP7BPESY29&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.-Kbuyc6r_LWofNFUvUlSTWZ-4Hc2RNoldj5qDm5r88wqdZ6Xo8tZroq96i3lQDZ7.g_pVjOolxe9dypGy1gyuKrKwDjT07Yceo3B5mxj8PqA&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=anna+kadabra+peligro+en+la+mansi%C3%B3n&amp;qid=1717342071&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=anna+kadabra+peligro+en+%2Cstripbooks%2C105&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Kadabra 13.

Is it still the same?</em>" and he says something like... "<em>dad, if you remove anything... the story is no longer the same</em>", and he's not wrong ü§£.

This, along with the last meeting with my son's teacher, who again hinted that I shouldn't be so demanding with the summaries, <strong>I've decided to relax and see it from another perspective</strong> üßòüíÜ.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-conclusions">My conclusions<a href="#my-conclusions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My conclusions" title="Direct link to My conclusions">‚Äã</a></h2><p>I have to get used to the fact that the summary is not <em>that important</em> (for now). What is important is that my son:</p><ul><li><strong>Keeps enjoying reading</strong>.</li><li><strong>Continues developing his reading speed and comprehension</strong>.</li><li><strong>Learns vocabulary</strong>.</li><li>And above all, <strong>doesn't start disliking reading</strong> because after... there's going to be a time of "dad's anger" ;(.</li></ul><p>So now what I've asked him to do is that when he reads a book:</p><ul><li>Have a blank sheet of paper at hand.</li><li>Write down all the words he doesn't know.</li><li>And ask Alexa (<a href="https://www.amazon.es/echo-show-5-3a-generacion/dp/B09B2S8WKD/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;crid=1OUHNQYCKE44R&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iltfLFjhhpdfcrA9zwPEASiiau-PIgl9VcVBJ0Oys_mCTQROVOODJpcW3qujKJ4uE1kn8QpTNL8Z-Ack1Tq9WU7C-LTEtxlvDoafnTJ_eg8HjePETtV-67qphoEQL1gvYpwxm_pR913C2qJrOLV7qzvzyiTtsKBCKr8OXVlmn6pXps9cPji2GZmCo1YhZnWudymyrsIxsywOMsAxpDflraEiQqz2Jfe357ryQ0o2Ttc.1wETnQEDVJoyYReccEOyXD41MFzajElaVfEmnAF04Wo&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=alexa+pantalla&amp;qid=1717344456&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=alexa+pantalla%2Cstripbooks%2C118&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Echo Show</a>) what they mean, and write them down.

href="#communities-in-recess" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Communities in recess?" title="Direct link to Communities in recess?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Are the communities in recess?, are the communities having more problems now than before?</p><p>After talking to many people, and in different forums, such as the Open Space, my perception is that there is a general feeling about the <strong>drop of activity in many of the technology communities</strong> (both in Spain and abroad) <strong>in the last few years</strong>, especially since the pandemic.</p><p>By "drop of activity" I mean a mix of things, but mainly I mean a lower attendance to meetings (face-to-face and online), interactions in mailing lists/IMs, etc.</p><p>And this situation, worries those of us who energize communities.</p><p>One of the concerns that I have heard recurrently is that the average age of the people who are part of these communities is growing, or said with other words, that <strong>it is difficult to attract and engage the new generations</strong>. </p><p>Personally, I am reluctant to believe that this is because the experience offered by the communities no longer provides as much value to the new generations as other new formats, channels or "forums". </p><p>But before we continue... what is a community?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7"

community?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Or rather, <strong>what do I mean by community, or technology community</strong>?</p><p>Perhaps it is good to start with this question, since for example, during the Open Space, in my opinion, there were times when the conversation revolved around different concepts of "community". </p><div style="text-align:center"><figure><p><a target="_blank"

as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">communities of practice</a>", which in short are <strong>groups of people</strong>(user groups, associations, meetups...) that:</p><ul><li><strong>organize regular meetings</strong> (face-to-face and/or online).</li><li><strong>share a passion / profession / concerns, ... for technology</strong> (software, hardware, methodologies or best practices, ...).</li><li>mainly, <strong>seek to collaborate with each other, voluntarily and altruistically</strong>.</li><li>they <strong>seek the common benefit</strong> above the particular one (including the particular interest of the organizations that may support/sponsor them).</li><li>are <strong>always open to new people</strong>.</li><li>feel part of the group and identify with it.</li></ul><p>So, I just wanted to clarify that:</p><ol><li>All this is in my experience and is based primarily on the type of communities I just described. </li><li>I believe that most of the ideas and tips shared in <a href="/docs/category/-tech-communities">the documents</a>, can be applied to this type of communities, whether they are local (in small and in big cities), as much as online/virtual, regardless of the fact that each one has its peculiarities.</li></ol><p>Having said all of the above, it does not detract from the fact that some of <strong>the tips can also be applied to people who are in the business of disseminating online content, or people who organize large conferences</strong>. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-has-changed">What has changed?<a href="#what-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What has changed?" title="Direct link to What has changed?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Why do those of us who have been energizing communities have this feeling/perception?</p><p>To give some context, I started to get involved with this particular type of communities at the university (in ~2009), and since then <a href="https://www.rauljimenez.info/docs/about-me/open-culture#communities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I have participated, contributed, founded and co-organized quite a few communities</a>, organizing hundreds of meetings (of all kinds).</p><p>Based on this experience, I would say that the feeling that activity is declining is mainly due to the fact that <strong>it is harder for us to provide value</strong> as we did before.</p><p>Now the offer is wider and the attention is diversifying with the increase of communities, channels/media (Discords, Slacks, social newtwords, ...), but also the rise of <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/828546487369990144/members" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">influencers</a>. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The image shows a cluttered room, a person hiding behind his hands, drowned between screens and cables."

eating more ground to the physical, just see that <strong>almost everything is done through apps</strong>: order food, a cab, talk / chat, procedures with the administration, ... even flirting! üòÖ and I have no doubt that this also has consequences. </p><p>That is why I believe that it is not that communities do not provide value, but that they simply <strong>have to take into account this change of context and reinvent/modernize themselves</strong>. Remember, as Albert Einstein said, "<em>The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results</em>."</p><p>I hope that sharing some of the <strong>advice</strong> I heard at the Open Space, and some of my own, will serve to <strong>help refloat some communities and help new ones to emerge</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>A book I really like that talks about adapting to change is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Spencer-Johnson/dp/0399144463/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;crid=39BAFS7MV20R5&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zoT19YfaR2b08zVkjZe2e0OGdTMvrcOsvxtxkGnEU8moy5ou07-LLppVg8nedZprast3hMhTFCJaue9jlJgmw6ZsGnYK7H_L4l-zmECV3z4vsCf3Kb_4qbqZocy25grVymjCcjGOP4h2gaGylJ11DaDG5sN6Kk6FN_eJhS3y2OgVl2kcp5Lpm4xt-0TcK40SOUV0_mJS9wcVA0Nv14Qo0yP1jiKp2qbjKGpntuuDnQY.9rIUivJpeFpsMntNHayamLjJElSNfNsjOGx_HRWO-qw&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=Who+took+my+cheese%3F&amp;qid=1712813883&amp;sprefix=who+took+my+cheese+%2Caps%2C217&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Moved My Cheese?</a> üßÄüêÅ.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="anatomy-of-communities">Anatomy of communities<a href="#anatomy-of-communities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Anatomy of communities" title="Direct link to Anatomy of communities">‚Äã</a></h2><p>And before I finish, I wanted to share some ideas and resources to share my understanding of communities.</p><p>The most basic are the <strong>degrees of involvement</strong>.

It is one of the largest <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1571289000886910977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">events for developers that is held annually in Spain</a>. It is well attended and draws strong participation from around 50 Spanish technical communities.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of the venue&amp;#39;s lobby during event registration" src="/assets/images/commitconf23-checkin-37cb452971ff608dc49a74037b42e271.jpg" width="826" height="223" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-attend-conferences-like-commitconf">Why attend conferences like CommitConf?<a href="#why-attend-conferences-like-commitconf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why attend conferences like CommitConf?" title="Direct link to Why attend conferences like CommitConf?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>At the conference, developers were brought together to <strong>retrain, discover, and share new insight and knowledge about our profession</strong>. For example, attendees shared information about:</p><ul><li>New tools and languages.</li><li>New capabilities for the tools and languages already used by the community.</li><li>How companies solve different software development challenges.</li><li>Best practices in accessibility, security, and design patterns.</li><li>New trends.</li></ul><p>Additionally, the conference provided a place to meet new people and reconnect with those already known. At events like this, it‚Äôs not uncommon to run into people you know! In my case, I bumped into some of my former colleagues, and some developers who use <strong><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArcGIS to create Location-Aware apps or map applications</a></strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Selfies taken by Raul with other developers during the event." src="/assets/images/commitconf23-developers-71f22a5a9c02eb7cd3bde91682ab0aea.jpg" width="826" height="194" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-made-this-conference-special">What made this conference special?<a href="#what-made-this-conference-special" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What made this conference special?" title="Direct link to What made this conference special?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>This event, like many others, gives us, developers, the opportunity to <strong>present talks, workshops, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Spaces</a></strong>.</p><p>For attendees, a unique factor that sets this event apart from others is the system used to create the event‚Äòs agenda, <strong>allowing the communities themselves to be involved in the selection process of talks</strong>. This system is called <a href="https://koliseo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koliseo</a> and is free for anyone to use.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-submit-a-proposal">Why submit a proposal?<a href="#why-submit-a-proposal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why submit a proposal?" title="Direct link to Why submit a proposal?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>Going to an event like CommitConf <strong>is an opportunity to learn from and contribute to the developer community</strong>. And, there are many different motivations for a person to send a proposal.</p><ul><li>There are people who simply <strong>enjoy sharing knowledge and experiences</strong>. </li><li>Other attendees want to <strong>increase the visibility of their company</strong> and to raise awareness of the cool work they do, <strong>with the hope of attracting new talent</strong>. </li><li>Some attendees want to <strong>create a personal brand</strong>.</li><li>While others want to <strong>discuss and find solutions to a problem with their colleagues</strong>.</li></ul><p>And if you are lucky enough to have a proposal accepted, as in my case, you can <strong>attend the speakers‚Äô dinner</strong> the day before the event, where you meet a lot of experts on different topics üòç. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-did-esri-bring-to-the-conference">What did Esri bring to the conference?<a href="#what-did-esri-bring-to-the-conference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What did Esri bring to the conference?" title="Direct link to What did Esri bring to the conference?">‚Äã</a></h2><p>From the company I work for (<a href="http://esri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esri</a>), they have always encouraged me to attend to conferences and to send proposals that I thought might be relevant to other developers.</p><p>This time, I presented a variety of proposals:</p><ul><li>DataViz &amp; Map Optimization</li><li>Designing Beautiful and Intelligent Maps</li><li>Using and Creating Collections in Postman Like a Pro</li><li><strong>üîëüîí OAuth, OpenID Connect and JWT for Dummies</strong></li></ul><p>I was lucky that the conference organizers accepted ‚ÄúOAuth, OpenID Connect, and JWT for Dummies‚Äù because it gave me the <strong>opportunity to share what these auth standards are and how they work</strong>. I showed practical examples based on some of the resources that we have created from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VMTWv3XRwWL4zG7rB8SlHkE5XXbd5OW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esri's Developer Experience team</a>, like the <strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/esridevs/workspace/authentication-in-arcgis/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authentication workspace in Postman</a></strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of Raul&amp;#39;s talk during his talk on oAuth showing Raul speaking and the audience of about 100 people." src="/assets/images/commitconf23-raul-jimenez-ortega-25a1c81cf261d9282bde9b4e306cef11.jpg" width="826" height="465" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In case you want, you can <strong><a href="https://bit.ly/oauth-commit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check the slides out here</a></strong>.

I had the opportunity to share tips and ideas to overcome challenges in creating and maintaining developer communities with approximately thirty other people. Among them were representatives from different communities about Python, Software Crafting, Data, Machine Learning, generalists‚Äô communities, Free Software, GNU/Linux, DevOps, Drupal, and us representing the <a href="https://meetup.com/es-ES/geo-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoDevelopers community</a>.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: After the session, I decided to create a guide with what we learned and our own experience.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I wanted to share another thought I had, this time it is: "<strong>everything has a positive side, even having a bad memory</strong>", although perhaps Leonard Shelby (from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Memento</a>) wouldn't think the same xD.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/memento-20ddf0f62be4fe8050914e4ac7291578.png" width="400" height="267" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Those who know me know that I am a quite active person, always coming up with new ideas, projects, etc., and you know that I always say I have a bad memory (which is true). Sometimes I think it's because I don't exercise my memory much, although sometimes I think it's due to my "hyperactivity."</p><p>Who knows why.... the thing is, sometimes it "annoys me" to think that "I am this way," but this time I reflected and thought... well... having a bad memory is not always bad. Why? In my opinion, because:</p><ol><li><strong>It forces me to be more structured</strong>, for example:<ul><li>When it comes to work, I try to document all procedures.</li><li>Procedures or work that I later share; for example, in articles on this blog like: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2014/04/06/pacto-de-socios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Partner Agreement</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2014/01/06/plantilla-para-crear-un-plan-de-analitica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Template for Creating an Analytics Plan</a>, etc.</li><li>I tend to use many task management tools that I later reuse in my work.</li></ul></li><li>Also, <strong>I make myself write more</strong> about what I have done so I don't forget it<ol><li>For example, my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/category/sobre-mi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">life summary posts</a> which also serve to keep my friends updated on how I am.</li><li>And to share <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2013/12/08/el-trabajo-perfecto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">articles like this one</a>, which are thoughts I want to internalize (and writing helps).</li></ol></li><li>And finally, it also <strong>helps you forget problems sooner or lessen the importance</strong> of many of them.</li></ol><p>In short, if someone ever criticizes you for having a bad memory, maybe you can counter-argue that... having a bad memory also has its advantages, what do you think?</p><p>By the way, this reasoning also applies to "<strong>having scattered attention</strong>," anyone dare to justify the good in this? ^_^</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many people still hesitate to take the step of paying a fee to subscribe to a good online training service; and today I wanted to advocate for it because I believe it is more cost-effective compared to other formal training alternatives. In my case, I decided to bet on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://www.codeschool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeSchool</a> in June of last year, for me <strong>the best platform</strong> that exists to stay updated and <strong>improve programming skills</strong>.</p><p>Personally, when it comes to educational platforms, I prefer those that require me to submit exercises to obtain certification, as they involve putting what I've learned into practice and therefore, I believe, provide some validity. Here are a few other platforms with MOOCs that follow this line where you can find free courses (with paid certifications): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://coursera.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://miriadax.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miriadax</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeAcademy</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EDX</a> (<em>thanks Pino for this last one!</em>).</p><p>Well, in my case I pay a <strong>$25 per month</strong> subscription on Codeschool, which over these months (including discounts) has amounted to about ‚Ç¨125, and although this may seem like a considerable amount, I think if we analyze what I've gained in return it offers a different perspective.</p><p>For example, during this time I have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/users/227734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completed 9</a> of the 36 courses they have available:</p><p>‚Äì <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javascript Road Trip Part 1</a> <strong>(Free)</strong><br>
