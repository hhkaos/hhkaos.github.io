            <description><![CDATA[📄 Note: The interactive version of this article is available at Dev.to 🇺🇸🇬🇧 & Medium.com 🇪🇸.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><strong>📄 Note</strong>: The interactive version of this article is available at <a href="https://dev.to/hhkaos/why-attend-developer-conferences-59b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dev.to 🇺🇸🇬🇧</a> &amp; <a href="https://medium.com/@hhkaos/por-qu%C3%A9-asistir-a-conferencias-para-desarrolladores-4c22cbe132cf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium.com 🇪🇸</a>.</p></blockquote><hr><p>If you want to know what the benefits of attending developer conferences like <a href="https://2023.commit-conf.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CommitConf</a> and why you should consider submitting a proposal for a talk or workshop, keep reading! 😄.</p><p>Recently, I was fortunate enough to attend CommitConf. It is one of the largest <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1571289000886910977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">events for developers that is held annually in Spain</a>. It is well attended and draws strong participation from around 50 Spanish technical communities.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of the venue&amp;#39;s lobby during event registration" src="/assets/images/commitconf23-checkin-37cb452971ff608dc49a74037b42e271.jpg" width="826" height="223" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-attend-conferences-like-commitconf">Why attend conferences like CommitConf?<a href="#why-attend-conferences-like-commitconf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why attend conferences like CommitConf?" title="Direct link to Why attend conferences like CommitConf?">​</a></h2><p>At the conference, developers were brought together to <strong>retrain, discover, and share new insight and knowledge about our profession</strong>. For example, attendees shared information about:</p><ul><li>New tools and languages.</li><li>New capabilities for the tools and languages already used by the community.</li><li>How companies solve different software development challenges.</li><li>Best practices in accessibility, security, and design patterns.</li><li>New trends.</li></ul><p>Additionally, the conference provided a place to meet new people and reconnect with those already known. At events like this, it’s not uncommon to run into people you know! In my case, I bumped into some of my former colleagues, and some developers who use <strong><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArcGIS to create Location-Aware apps or map applications</a></strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Selfies taken by Raul with other developers during the event." src="/assets/images/commitconf23-developers-71f22a5a9c02eb7cd3bde91682ab0aea.jpg" width="826" height="194" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-made-this-conference-special">What made this conference special?<a href="#what-made-this-conference-special" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What made this conference special?" title="Direct link to What made this conference special?">​</a></h2><p>This event, like many others, gives us, developers, the opportunity to <strong>present talks, workshops, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Spaces</a></strong>.</p><p>For attendees, a unique factor that sets this event apart from others is the system used to create the event‘s agenda, <strong>allowing the communities themselves to be involved in the selection process of talks</strong>. This system is called <a href="https://koliseo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koliseo</a> and is free for anyone to use.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-submit-a-proposal">Why submit a proposal?<a href="#why-submit-a-proposal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why submit a proposal?" title="Direct link to Why submit a proposal?">​</a></h2><p>Going to an event like CommitConf <strong>is an opportunity to learn from and contribute to the developer community</strong>. And, there are many different motivations for a person to send a proposal.</p><ul><li>There are people who simply <strong>enjoy sharing knowledge and experiences</strong>. </li><li>Other attendees want to <strong>increase the visibility of their company</strong> and to raise awareness of the cool work they do, <strong>with the hope of attracting new talent</strong>. </li><li>Some attendees want to <strong>create a personal brand</strong>.</li><li>While others want to <strong>discuss and find solutions to a problem with their colleagues</strong>.</li></ul><p>And if you are lucky enough to have a proposal accepted, as in my case, you can <strong>attend the speakers’ dinner</strong> the day before the event, where you meet a lot of experts on different topics 😍. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-did-esri-bring-to-the-conference">What did Esri bring to the conference?<a href="#what-did-esri-bring-to-the-conference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What did Esri bring to the conference?" title="Direct link to What did Esri bring to the conference?">​</a></h2><p>From the company I work for (<a href="http://esri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esri</a>), they have always encouraged me to attend to conferences and to send proposals that I thought might be relevant to other developers.</p><p>This time, I presented a variety of proposals:</p><ul><li>DataViz &amp; Map Optimization</li><li>Designing Beautiful and Intelligent Maps</li><li>Using and Creating Collections in Postman Like a Pro</li><li><strong>🔑🔒 OAuth, OpenID Connect and JWT for Dummies</strong></li></ul><p>I was lucky that the conference organizers accepted “OAuth, OpenID Connect, and JWT for Dummies” because it gave me the <strong>opportunity to share what these auth standards are and how they work</strong>. I showed practical examples based on some of the resources that we have created from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VMTWv3XRwWL4zG7rB8SlHkE5XXbd5OW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esri's Developer Experience team</a>, like the <strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/esridevs/workspace/authentication-in-arcgis/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authentication workspace in Postman</a></strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of Raul&amp;#39;s talk during his talk on oAuth showing Raul speaking and the audience of about 100 people." src="/assets/images/commitconf23-raul-jimenez-ortega-25a1c81cf261d9282bde9b4e306cef11.jpg" width="826" height="465" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In case you want, you can <strong><a href="https://bit.ly/oauth-commit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check the slides out here</a></strong>. If you are interested in the topic and want me to repeat this talk online, just let me know in the comments!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-did-i-learn-at-the-conference">What did I learn at the conference?<a href="#what-did-i-learn-at-the-conference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What did I learn at the conference?" title="Direct link to What did I learn at the conference?">​</a></h2><p>Below are some of the takeaways from the sessions that I attended:</p><ul><li><strong>Local Communities Outside Big Cities (Open Space)</strong>: This session was super interesting. I had the opportunity to share tips and ideas to overcome challenges in creating and maintaining developer communities with approximately thirty other people. Among them were representatives from different communities about Python, Software Crafting, Data, Machine Learning, generalists’ communities, Free Software, GNU/Linux, DevOps, Drupal, and us representing the <a href="https://meetup.com/es-ES/geo-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoDevelopers community</a>.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: After the session, I decided to create a guide with what we learned and our own experience. If you are interested, save the article in favourites because we will add it <strong>[here]</strong> in a few weeks.</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of the Open Space on communities showing about thirty attendees seated in a circle." src="/assets/images/commitcont23-openspace-600b7ea1816f53041aa3830da01b7a17.jpg" width="826" height="463" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li><p><strong>Detecting Web Performance Issues with Chrome DevTools</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/nucliweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@nucliweb</a> gave an overview of the Chrome DevTools and showed us how they keep adding new tools like <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/recorder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recorder</a> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coverage</a> to help evaluate your web performance and optimize it. Also, he showed us how the new AVIF image format improves WebP performance. More info at <a href="https://web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web.dev</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t Yell at Me, I Can’t See You</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/javierabadia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@javierabadia</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jameshedaweng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@jameshedaweng</a> explained to us how to divide the responsibilities between an Engineering Manager and a Product Manager to avoid failure when creating a product. In summary, a PM must be responsible for <em>what</em> features to add and <em>why</em>, and the EM in the <em>how</em> and the <em>who</em>. The <em>when</em> should be a shared responsibility.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why I Decided to Pursue the Developer Relations Path</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/kinisoftware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@kinisoftware</a> told us about his experience as a Staff Developer Relations Engineer, where he works to promote the expertise of Criteo’s technical team by facilitating participation in events and communities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing Web Accessibility</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/bolonio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@bolonio</a> showed us a multitude of tools and resources for testing web accessibility: <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe-core</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jest-axe</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe-core/cli</a>, <a href="https://pa11y.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pa11y</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pa11y-ci</a>, <a href="http://deque.com/axe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe chrome extension</a>, <a href="http://paciellogroup.com/toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arc toolkit</a>, <a href="http://accessibilityinsights.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessibilityinsights.io</a>, <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wave.webaim.org</a>, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Mistake of Becoming a Manager</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/npatarino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@npatarino</a> explained to us that becoming a manager of people is not the only way to have leadership or increase your salary. He said that for those senior software engineers who want to continue growing, there are other positions such as Staff Software Engineer, Principal Software Engineer, Distinguished Software Engineer and Technical Fellow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Past, Present and Future of EducaMadrid</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/asanzdiego" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@asanzdiego</a> talked to us about the educational platform of the Community of Madrid that he leads; he told us about the technical challenges they suffered during the pandemic, when the number of active users grew exponentially, along with the strengths and limitations of his team and his technological stack based on free software.</p></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Composition of photographs of different sessions attended by Raul." src="/assets/images/commitconf23-techsessions-719b97091a6fcea3d34f9e95f9e53268.jpg" width="826" height="402" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In summary, if you don't use to go to developer conferences, <strong>I hope my experience has encouraged you and given you arguments to attend in the future</strong>. I would say also to the <strong><a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esri Developer Summit in the USA</a></strong> (or <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit-europe/save-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in Europe</a>), although this rather applies if you are an Esri partner or customer 😉.</p><p>Remember, <strong>although much of the content of these conferences is then made available online, there are many other things that can only be achieved by attending.</strong></p><blockquote><p>If you want to leave comments, you can do it in <a href="https://dev.to/hhkaos/why-attend-developer-conferences-59b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the article published in Dev.to</a></p></blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to my new website!, it was time for a change...😁</p><p>Some of you might remember <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322140938/http://rauljimenez.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the old website</a> I built back in 2013:</p><p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160322140938/http://rauljimenez.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of rauljimenez.info old website" src="/assets/images/rauljimenez.info-47d71d02435be4ef651ef69061e1f929.png" width="1509" height="1069" class="img_ev3q"></a></p><p>Back in the days, I decided to build that website to introduce myself, share some thoughts, and give updates about my life to my friends.</p><p>Today I have decided to replace it for this new website built with <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docusaurus.io</a> for several reasons, but mainly because I will be:</p><ul><li><strong>Easier to maintain and update</strong> (no backend and almost everything in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">markdown</a>),</li><li>Able to <strong>share resources in Spanish and English</strong>.</li><li><strong>Allow you to contribute/repurpose the content I share</strong> (it is <a href="https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hosted on GitHub</a>).</li></ul><p>So, the next step is to start migrating the content I could rescue <a href="https://blog.rauljimenez.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from my blog</a> and put it here.</p><p>I have always thought that it is a pity to create resources and leave them in a drawer, so from now on I plan to start taking many of the resources that I have created over the years and share them in what I have defined as my <a href="/docs/digital-brain">"🧠 Digital Brain"</a>. </p><p>I'm starting by compiling <a href="https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/issues/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all the resources I could share</a>, so please, if you are interested in one in particular let me know in the comments.</p><p>This tool is not meant to be a social tool where you can subscribe, so if you want to stay up to date on what I share I will be republishing my articles in two channels:</p><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/@hhkaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://medium.com/@hhkaos</a> for Spanish speakers</li><li><a href="https://dev.to/hhkaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://dev.to/hhkaos</a> for English speakers</li></ul><p>I hope you like it, and any suggestions are more than welcome.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Os dejo otro par de plataformas con MOOCs que siguen esta línea donde podréis encontrar cursos gratuitos (con certificaciones de pago):&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://coursera.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coursera</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://miriadax.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Miriadax</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeAcademy</a>&nbsp;y&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EDX</a>&nbsp;(<em>gracias Pino por esta última!</em>).</p><p>Bueno, pues en mi caso pago una cuota de&nbsp;<strong>25 dólares al mes</strong>&nbsp;en Codeschool, lo que en estos meses (con descuentos incluidos) han sido unos 125€ y aunque pueda parecer una cantidad considerable, creo que si analizamos lo que he adquirido a cambio le da otra perspectiva diferente.</p><p>Por ejemplo, yo en este tiempo&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/users/227734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he hecho 9</a>&nbsp;de los 36 cursos que tienen disponibles:</p><p>–&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Javascript Road Trip Part 1</a>&nbsp;<strong>(Gratuito)</strong><br>

Si hacemos las cuentas creo que sale a un precio bastante razonable ya que los cursos son de una tremenda calidad e incluyen un montón de ejercicios prácticos que creo&nbsp;<strong>me están haciendo un mejor profesional</strong>.</p><p>¿Qué opináis vosotros al respecto?, en&nbsp;<strong>comparación con otras posibilidades de formación</strong>: talleres, workshops de formación, masters, etc.&nbsp;<strong>¿no os parece un buen precio?</strong>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
