For example:</p><ul><li>A talk to 3rd and 4th-year ESO students (14 to 16 years old) at a career guidance event, where I shared my experience with them (starting from when I was their age until today).</li><li>A discussion with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrielzabal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gabriel Zabal</a>, for parents with children over 10 years old, mainly focused on the risks associated with new technologies, using social networks as a guiding thread but touching on many other topics.</li><li>Or my experience participating with them in the sports day championships.</li></ul><p>If you are interested in these topics, let me know in the <a href="#comments">comments</a> (to prioritize it) 😉.</p><p>BTW, in case you need it, here is a table of course equivalencies between countries:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Spain</th><th>USA</th><th>Canada</th><th>Ireland</th><th>United Kingdom</th><th>France</th><th>Germany</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1st ESO</td><td>Grade 7</td><td>Grade 7</td><td>1st Year</td><td>Year 8</td><td>Collège 5e</td><td>7 Klasse</td></tr><tr><td>2nd ESO</td><td>Grade 8</td><td>Grade 8</td><td>2nd Year</td><td>Year 9</td><td>Collège 4e</td><td>8 Klasse</td></tr><tr><td>3rd ESO</td><td>Grade 9</td><td>Grade 9</td><td>3rd Year</td><td>Year 10</td><td>Collège 3e</td><td>9 Klasse</td></tr><tr><td>4th ESO</td><td>Grade 10</td><td>Grade 10</td><td>4th Year</td><td>Year 11 &amp; GCSE</td><td>Seconde</td><td>10 Klasse</td></tr><tr><td>1st Bachillerato</td><td>Grade 11</td><td>Grade 11</td><td>5th Year</td><td>Year 12</td><td>Première</td><td>11 Klasse</td></tr><tr><td>2nd Bachillerato</td><td>Grade 12</td><td>Grade 12</td><td>6th Year</td><td>Year 13 &amp; A Levels</td><td>Terminale</td><td>12 Klasse</td></tr></tbody></table><p></p></div></div></details><p>Those who know me know that I am used to giving training and talks to adults, but <strong>helping a 7-year-old child learn to study</strong>... is something totally different, and it is proving to be quite a challenge 😅.</p><div style="text-align:center"><p>  <img loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/teaching-at-home-0a95392e8a794ea9d11e658c2a2fb1eb.png" width="1520" height="710" class="img_ev3q"></p></div><p>So today I want to talk about <strong>my experience trying to help my son José summarize books</strong>, how I have come to feel frustrated by setting my expectations too high, and the conclusions I have reached.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-context">The context<a href="#the-context" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The context" title="Direct link to The context">​</a></h2><p>To give you some background:</p><ul><li><strong>Every two weeks he brings a book from school home</strong>.</li><li>These are books that himself and his classmates have brought to class, usually bought by the parents.</li><li>They are asked to fill out a worksheet after reading where they have to make a summary of about half a page.</li><li>These books are like <a href="https://www.amazon.es/anna-kadabra/s?k=anna+kadabra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Kadabra</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.es/Pok%C3%A9mon-Aventuras-Gigamax-combate-FlipAventura/dp/8418594330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pokémon</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.es/Marcus-Pocus-1-Magia-domicilio/dp/8408254154/ref=sr_1_1?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.nzcrwM6Pe2S_Yq-RGmFVs5UHO5uYgDEnS27SX3-dKkyIID6F589uCXo4WGgeoMA0-C3q4-XOdlq1iTI6fgXsgca0UygLzFEr_3ykPMNsZewxzuF3g3FzSh2dg_Sg_uCylpqvypA1r482QA6el_wuYWZ0KEVCHo4yrroqPAlPuuQ51YtSsLfbp6q0dFObpBz37nDGzJuGnE2KGmy9027r7CcnX3vORc6JTgijZn1A4jBi6LMKoa69mrO5KzOr-vlYBixpTTdQqTQOmOZvAnAX2NhbeDuVnO57ZgHZWk9bH7M.5Snv_xMSWF2rmR9Rof5iyCbwGj_4VuYOheFuguN24J4&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=marcus+pocus&amp;qid=1717312424&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marcus Pocus</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dogman-series-Books/s?k=dogman+series&amp;rh=n%3A283155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dog Man</a>, ... which mostly have <strong>+100 pages</strong>.</li><li>Lastly, they have the &quot;reading challenge&quot; (optional), where each month they are encouraged to choose another book that meets certain characteristics.

So, with the idea of helping him improve them, I start asking him questions, to see if I can understand the plot better, but still <strong>I&#x27;m missing characters, or clarifications, or anything else</strong> that makes it hard for me to understand the story.</p><p>In the end, both his mother and I decided that the best thing would be for <strong>one of us to also read the book</strong>, so we could help him because otherwise, how would we know if he had missed something important or not?</p><p>Well... something that initially didn&#x27;t seem complicated, I realized was more difficult than I thought 😅.</p><p>One of the things I have noticed while reading the books is that <strong>every one or two pages, there are words that I suspect he doesn&#x27;t know</strong>, like <em>exhalation</em>, <em>arrogant</em>, <em>seep</em>, <em>utopian</em>, <em>electoral campaign</em>, ..., so every time I read one of his books, I ask him to verify. </p><p>Indeed, many he doesn&#x27;t know, and I always tell him:</p><blockquote><p><em>José, when you don&#x27;t understand something...ask what it means! Because if you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re probably not understanding the story well.</em></p></blockquote><p>I always do it... even when I&#x27;m reading <a href="https://www.amazon.es/Libros-Mikecrack/s?rh=n%3A599364031%2Cp_27%3AMikecrack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mikecrack</a> stories to him and his brother in bed before sleeping, but no matter how much I repeat it... there comes a time when he stops asking.</p><p>But well, once the entire book is read and all the vocabulary is reviewed, we move on to the summary. There, my method consists of reminding him that every story has:</p><ul><li>A <strong>beginning</strong>, where something usually happens that disrupts the order and:<ol><li>Creates a problem to solve.</li><li>Is the trigger for an adventure.</li></ol></li><li>Then there&#x27;s the <strong>development</strong> (or middle), which is what is told in most of the book.</li><li>Then there&#x27;s an <strong>end</strong> (or conclusion), where the situation is resolved, or the story ends, and everything returns to normal.</li><li>And besides this, there are some <strong>characters</strong> more important than others, without whom the story could not be told well.</li></ul><p>And then I ask him to, using those four elements, tell me what happens at the beginning, the most important things that happen before reaching the end, how everything is resolved and returns to normal, and while doing that, explain who each of the characters are.</p><p>Well, as you can imagine, despite all attempts and trying to give him hints, because to be honest, <strong>even I sometimes find it hard to summarize</strong>... I can&#x27;t get the summary to meet my expectations 😅, which ends in my frustration 😡, for which I then have to apologize to him, explaining that it is not his fault but my own frustration for not being able to help him 😞.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="asking-for-help-from-the-teacher">Asking for help from the teacher<a href="#asking-for-help-from-the-teacher" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Asking for help from the teacher" title="Direct link to Asking for help from the teacher">​</a></h2><p>So I said to myself, &quot;<em>OK Raúl, you&#x27;re not doing it right, ask the teacher for help!</em>&quot; (and that&#x27;s what I did).</p><p>After talking to her, she gave me some advice.

This, along with the last meeting with my son&#x27;s teacher, who again hinted that I shouldn&#x27;t be so demanding with the summaries, <strong>I&#x27;ve decided to relax and see it from another perspective</strong> 🧘💆.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-conclusions">My conclusions<a href="#my-conclusions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My conclusions" title="Direct link to My conclusions">​</a></h2><p>I have to get used to the fact that the summary is not <em>that important</em> (for now). What is important is that my son:</p><ul><li><strong>Keeps enjoying reading</strong>.</li><li><strong>Continues developing his reading speed and comprehension</strong>.</li><li><strong>Learns vocabulary</strong>.</li><li>And above all, <strong>doesn&#x27;t start disliking reading</strong> because after... there&#x27;s going to be a time of &quot;dad&#x27;s anger&quot; ;(.</li></ul><p>So now what I&#x27;ve asked him to do is that when he reads a book:</p><ul><li>Have a blank sheet of paper at hand.</li><li>Write down all the words he doesn&#x27;t know.</li><li>And ask Alexa (<a href="https://www.amazon.es/echo-show-5-3a-generacion/dp/B09B2S8WKD/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;crid=1OUHNQYCKE44R&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iltfLFjhhpdfcrA9zwPEASiiau-PIgl9VcVBJ0Oys_mCTQROVOODJpcW3qujKJ4uE1kn8QpTNL8Z-Ack1Tq9WU7C-LTEtxlvDoafnTJ_eg8HjePETtV-67qphoEQL1gvYpwxm_pR913C2qJrOLV7qzvzyiTtsKBCKr8OXVlmn6pXps9cPji2GZmCo1YhZnWudymyrsIxsywOMsAxpDflraEiQqz2Jfe357ryQ0o2Ttc.1wETnQEDVJoyYReccEOyXD41MFzajElaVfEmnAF04Wo&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=alexa+pantalla&amp;qid=1717344456&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=alexa+pantalla%2Cstripbooks%2C118&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Echo Show</a>) what they mean, and write them down.

in recess?<a href="#communities-in-recess" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Communities in recess?" title="Direct link to Communities in recess?">​</a></h2><p>Are the communities in recess?, are the communities having more problems now than before?</p><p>After talking to many people, and in different forums, such as the Open Space, my perception is that there is a general feeling about the <strong>drop of activity in many of the technology communities</strong> (both in Spain and abroad) <strong>in the last few years</strong>, especially since the pandemic.</p><p>By &quot;drop of activity&quot; I mean a mix of things, but mainly I mean a lower attendance to meetings (face-to-face and online), interactions in mailing lists/IMs, etc.</p><p>And this situation, worries those of us who energize communities.</p><p>One of the concerns that I have heard recurrently is that the average age of the people who are part of these communities is growing, or said with other words, that <strong>it is difficult to attract and engage the new generations</strong>. </p><p>Personally, I am reluctant to believe that this is because the experience offered by the communities no longer provides as much value to the new generations as other new formats, channels or &quot;forums&quot;. </p><p>But before we continue... what is a community?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-a-community">What is a community?<a href="#what-is-a-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is a community?" title="Direct link to What is a community?">​</a></h2><p>Or rather, <strong>what do I mean by community, or technology community</strong>?</p><p>Perhaps it is good to start with this question, since for example, during the Open Space, in my opinion, there were times when the conversation revolved around different concepts of &quot;community&quot;. </p><div style="text-align:center"><figure><p><a target="_blank" href="/assets/files/user-group-meetup-tech-community-df0ffb3c94116a56f31d01a6508eb7b5.png"><img loading="lazy" alt="Vibrant meeting space, technologists gather with faces animated by enthusiasm."

as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">communities of practice</a>&quot;, which in short are <strong>groups of people</strong>(user groups, associations, meetups...) that:</p><ul><li><strong>organize regular meetings</strong> (face-to-face and/or online).</li><li><strong>share a passion / profession / concerns, ... for technology</strong> (software, hardware, methodologies or best practices, ...).</li><li>mainly, <strong>seek to collaborate with each other, voluntarily and altruistically</strong>.</li><li>they <strong>seek the common benefit</strong> above the particular one (including the particular interest of the organizations that may support/sponsor them).</li><li>are <strong>always open to new people</strong>.</li><li>feel part of the group and identify with it.</li></ul><p>So, I just wanted to clarify that:</p><ol><li>All this is in my experience and is based primarily on the type of communities I just described. </li><li>I believe that most of the ideas and tips shared in <a href="/docs/category/-tech-communities">the documents</a>, can be applied to this type of communities, whether they are local (in small and in big cities), as much as online/virtual, regardless of the fact that each one has its peculiarities.</li></ol><p>Having said all of the above, it does not detract from the fact that some of <strong>the tips can also be applied to people who are in the business of disseminating online content, or people who organize large conferences</strong>. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-has-changed">What has changed?<a href="#what-has-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What has changed?" title="Direct link to What has changed?">​</a></h2><p>Why do those of us who have been energizing communities have this feeling/perception?</p><p>To give some context, I started to get involved with this particular type of communities at the university (in ~2009), and since then <a href="https://www.rauljimenez.info/docs/about-me/open-culture#communities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I have participated, contributed, founded and co-organized quite a few communities</a>, organizing hundreds of meetings (of all kinds).</p><p>Based on this experience, I would say that the feeling that activity is declining is mainly due to the fact that <strong>it is harder for us to provide value</strong> as we did before.</p><p>Now the offer is wider and the attention is diversifying with the increase of communities, channels/media (Discords, Slacks, social newtwords, ...), but also the rise of <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/828546487369990144/members" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">influencers</a>. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The

eating more ground to the physical, just see that <strong>almost everything is done through apps</strong>: order food, a cab, talk / chat, procedures with the administration, ... even flirting! 😅 and I have no doubt that this also has consequences. </p><p>That is why I believe that it is not that communities do not provide value, but that they simply <strong>have to take into account this change of context and reinvent/modernize themselves</strong>. Remember, as Albert Einstein said, &quot;<em>The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results</em>.&quot;</p><p>I hope that sharing some of the <strong>advice</strong> I heard at the Open Space, and some of my own, will serve to <strong>help refloat some communities and help new ones to emerge</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>A book I really like that talks about adapting to change is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Spencer-Johnson/dp/0399144463/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&amp;crid=39BAFS7MV20R5&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zoT19YfaR2b08zVkjZe2e0OGdTMvrcOsvxtxkGnEU8moy5ou07-LLppVg8nedZprast3hMhTFCJaue9jlJgmw6ZsGnYK7H_L4l-zmECV3z4vsCf3Kb_4qbqZocy25grVymjCcjGOP4h2gaGylJ11DaDG5sN6Kk6FN_eJhS3y2OgVl2kcp5Lpm4xt-0TcK40SOUV0_mJS9wcVA0Nv14Qo0yP1jiKp2qbjKGpntuuDnQY.9rIUivJpeFpsMntNHayamLjJElSNfNsjOGx_HRWO-qw&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=Who+took+my+cheese%3F&amp;qid=1712813883&amp;sprefix=who+took+my+cheese+%2Caps%2C217&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Moved My Cheese?</a> 🧀🐁.</p></blockquote><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="anatomy-of-communities">Anatomy of communities<a href="#anatomy-of-communities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Anatomy of communities" title="Direct link to Anatomy of communities">​</a></h2><p>And before I finish, I wanted to share some ideas and resources to share my understanding of communities.</p><p>The most basic are the <strong>degrees of involvement</strong>.

rel="noopener noreferrer">CommitConf</a> and why you should consider submitting a proposal for a talk or workshop, keep reading! 😄.</p><p>Recently, I was fortunate enough to attend CommitConf. It is one of the largest <a href="https://twitter.com/i/lists/1571289000886910977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">events for developers that is held annually in Spain</a>. It is well attended and draws strong participation from around 50 Spanish technical communities.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of the venue&amp;#39;s lobby during event registration" src="/assets/images/commitconf23-checkin-37cb452971ff608dc49a74037b42e271.jpg" width="826" height="223" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-attend-conferences-like-commitconf">Why attend conferences like CommitConf?<a href="#why-attend-conferences-like-commitconf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why attend conferences like CommitConf?" title="Direct link to Why attend conferences like CommitConf?">​</a></h2><p>At the conference, developers were brought together to <strong>retrain, discover, and share new insight and knowledge about our profession</strong>. For example, attendees shared information about:</p><ul><li>New tools and languages.</li><li>New capabilities for the tools and languages already used by the community.</li><li>How companies solve different software development challenges.</li><li>Best practices in accessibility, security, and design patterns.</li><li>New trends.</li></ul><p>Additionally, the conference provided a place to meet new people and reconnect with those already known. At events like this, it’s not uncommon to run into people you know! In my case, I bumped into some of my former colleagues, and some developers who use <strong><a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ArcGIS to create Location-Aware apps or map applications</a></strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Selfies taken by Raul with other developers during the event." src="/assets/images/commitconf23-developers-71f22a5a9c02eb7cd3bde91682ab0aea.jpg" width="826" height="194" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-made-this-conference-special">What made this conference special?<a href="#what-made-this-conference-special" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What made this conference special?" title="Direct link to What made this conference special?">​</a></h2><p>This event, like many others, gives us, developers, the opportunity to <strong>present talks, workshops, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open Spaces</a></strong>.</p><p>For attendees, a unique factor that sets this event apart from others is the system used to create the event‘s agenda, <strong>allowing the communities themselves to be involved in the selection process of talks</strong>. This system is called <a href="https://koliseo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koliseo</a> and is free for anyone to use.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-submit-a-proposal">Why submit a proposal?<a href="#why-submit-a-proposal" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why submit a proposal?" title="Direct link to Why submit a proposal?">​</a></h2><p>Going to an event like CommitConf <strong>is an opportunity to learn from and contribute to the developer community</strong>. And, there are many different motivations for a person to send a proposal.</p><ul><li>There are people who simply <strong>enjoy sharing knowledge and experiences</strong>. </li><li>Other attendees want to <strong>increase the visibility of their company</strong> and to raise awareness of the cool work they do, <strong>with the hope of attracting new talent</strong>. </li><li>Some attendees want to <strong>create a personal brand</strong>.</li><li>While others want to <strong>discuss and find solutions to a problem with their colleagues</strong>.</li></ul><p>And if you are lucky enough to have a proposal accepted, as in my case, you can <strong>attend the speakers’ dinner</strong> the day before the event, where you meet a lot of experts on different topics 😍. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-did-esri-bring-to-the-conference">What did Esri bring to the conference?<a href="#what-did-esri-bring-to-the-conference" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What did Esri bring to the conference?" title="Direct link to What did Esri bring to the conference?">​</a></h2><p>From the company I work for (<a href="http://esri.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esri</a>), they have always encouraged me to attend to conferences and to send proposals that I thought might be relevant to other developers.</p><p>This time, I presented a variety of proposals:</p><ul><li>DataViz &amp; Map Optimization</li><li>Designing Beautiful and Intelligent Maps</li><li>Using and Creating Collections in Postman Like a Pro</li><li><strong>🔑🔒 OAuth, OpenID Connect and JWT for Dummies</strong></li></ul><p>I was lucky that the conference organizers accepted “OAuth, OpenID Connect, and JWT for Dummies” because it gave me the <strong>opportunity to share what these auth standards are and how they work</strong>. I showed practical examples based on some of the resources that we have created from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VMTWv3XRwWL4zG7rB8SlHkE5XXbd5OW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esri&#x27;s Developer Experience team</a>, like the <strong><a href="https://www.postman.com/esridevs/workspace/authentication-in-arcgis/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Authentication workspace in Postman</a></strong>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of Raul&amp;#39;s talk during his talk on oAuth showing Raul speaking and the audience of about 100 people." src="/assets/images/commitconf23-raul-jimenez-ortega-25a1c81cf261d9282bde9b4e306cef11.jpg" width="826" height="465" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In case you want, you can <strong><a href="https://bit.ly/oauth-commit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">check the slides out here</a></strong>.

I had the opportunity to share tips and ideas to overcome challenges in creating and maintaining developer communities with approximately thirty other people. Among them were representatives from different communities about Python, Software Crafting, Data, Machine Learning, generalists’ communities, Free Software, GNU/Linux, DevOps, Drupal, and us representing the <a href="https://meetup.com/es-ES/geo-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoDevelopers community</a>.</li></ul><blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: After the session, I decided to create a guide with what we learned and our own experience. If you are interested, save the article in favourites because we will add it <strong>[here]</strong> in a few weeks.</p></blockquote><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of the Open Space on communities showing about thirty attendees seated in a circle." src="/assets/images/commitcont23-openspace-600b7ea1816f53041aa3830da01b7a17.jpg" width="826" height="463" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li><p><strong>Detecting Web Performance Issues with Chrome DevTools</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/nucliweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@nucliweb</a> gave an overview of the Chrome DevTools and showed us how they keep adding new tools like <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/recorder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recorder</a> and <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/coverage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coverage</a> to help evaluate your web performance and optimize it. Also, he showed us how the new AVIF image format improves WebP performance. More info at <a href="https://web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web.dev</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Don’t Yell at Me, I Can’t See You</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/javierabadia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@javierabadia</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jameshedaweng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@jameshedaweng</a> explained to us how to divide the responsibilities between an Engineering Manager and a Product Manager to avoid failure when creating a product. In summary, a PM must be responsible for <em>what</em> features to add and <em>why</em>, and the EM in the <em>how</em> and the <em>who</em>. The <em>when</em> should be a shared responsibility.</p></li><li><p><strong>Why I Decided to Pursue the Developer Relations Path</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/kinisoftware" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@kinisoftware</a> told us about his experience as a Staff Developer Relations Engineer, where he works to promote the expertise of Criteo’s technical team by facilitating participation in events and communities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing Web Accessibility</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/bolonio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@bolonio</a> showed us a multitude of tools and resources for testing web accessibility: <a href="https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe-core</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jest-axe</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe-core/cli</a>, <a href="https://pa11y.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pa11y</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pa11y-ci</a>, <a href="http://deque.com/axe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">axe chrome extension</a>, <a href="http://paciellogroup.com/toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arc toolkit</a>, <a href="http://accessibilityinsights.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessibilityinsights.io</a>, <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wave.webaim.org</a>, and more.</p></li><li><p><strong>The Mistake of Becoming a Manager</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/npatarino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@npatarino</a> explained to us that becoming a manager of people is not the only way to have leadership or increase your salary. He said that for those senior software engineers who want to continue growing, there are other positions such as Staff Software Engineer, Principal Software Engineer, Distinguished Software Engineer and Technical Fellow.</p></li><li><p><strong>Past, Present and Future of EducaMadrid</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/asanzdiego" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@asanzdiego</a> talked to us about the educational platform of the Community of Madrid that he leads; he told us about the technical challenges they suffered during the pandemic, when the number of active users grew exponentially, along with the strengths and limitations of his team and his technological stack based on free software.</p></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Composition of photographs of different sessions attended by Raul." src="/assets/images/commitconf23-techsessions-719b97091a6fcea3d34f9e95f9e53268.jpg" width="826" height="402" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In summary, if you don&#x27;t use to go to developer conferences, <strong>I hope my experience has encouraged you and given you arguments to attend in the future</strong>. I would say also to the <strong><a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Esri Developer Summit in the USA</a></strong> (or <a href="https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit-europe/save-date" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in Europe</a>), although this rather applies if you are an Esri partner or customer 😉.</p><p>Remember, <strong>although much of the content of these conferences is then made available online, there are many other things that can only be achieved by attending.</strong></p><blockquote><p>If you want to leave comments, you can do it in <a href="https://dev.to/hhkaos/why-attend-developer-conferences-59b3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the article published in Dev.to</a></p></blockquote></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/conferences">conferences</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/commitconf">commitconf</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/community">community</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/events">events</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"></nav></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">All contents on this site have been created with ❤️ and are licensed as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons, Attribution 4.0 International</a>.</div></div></div></footer></div>
