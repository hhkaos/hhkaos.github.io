Following a series of reflections that led me to consider [what a technical community is (for me)](../2024-07-04/index.md), I decided to start this series of articles that compile the most relevant facts from the world of technology and communities, with a special focus on Spain.

The goal is to document the history and help us reflect on the past, **understand how and why technological communities have evolved the way they have**, and establish a common framework to help dispel some of the current controversies. This way, hopefully, we can focus on what I believe is important... collaborating.

The articles I plan to publish soon are:
- [1975-1991: First associations and online communities](../2024-07-06/index.md).
- [1992-2003: The rise of online communities](../2024-07-07/index.md).
- 2004-2012: The emergence of modern conferences and tech meetups (*coming soon*).
- 2013-2020: Professionalization of communities (*coming soon*).
- 2020-2022: Communities during the Pandemic (COVID-19) (*coming soon*).
- 2022-2024: The return to reality for communities (*coming soon*).
