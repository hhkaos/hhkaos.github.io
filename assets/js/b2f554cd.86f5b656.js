I loved the SWAG this year, the design was A MAP created with GitHub *Commit* contributions! (Amazing work \ud83d\ude0d):\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n![Screenshot of GitHub commit summary](/img/blogs/commit-conf-2025-recap/commits.webp)\\n\\n<figcaption>GitHub contribution activity screenshot.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nOnce again, dozens of tech communities joined forces to help promote the event and select talks. In our case, through [the Geo Developers community](https://github.com/geo-developers).\xa0\\n\\nIn this post, I want to highlight three main things:\\n\\n- [Our talk about map APIs](#the-billion-dollar-code-).\\n- [Reconnecting with tech communities](#reconnecting-with-communities).\\n- [And what I learned from the talks and hallway chats](#lessons-learned-about-ai).\\n\\n## The Billion Dollar Code \ud83e\udd11\\n\\nWe named our talk after [the Netflix miniseries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Billion_Dollar_Code) (which we also used as a storytelling thread). Although my talk titles are usually more descriptive, this one had the intended effect \u2014 **we exceeded my expectations for attendance, and apparently those of the organizers too**, because the room was packed.\\n\\n[Juanma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmanera/) and I counted around 70 people:\\n\\n![Photo collage from our talk](/img/blogs/commit-conf-2025-recap/commit-conf-2025-collage-el-codigo-del-billon-de-dolares.webp)\\n\\nAs stated in the [abstract](https://koliseo.com/commit/commit-conf-2025/agenda/0?selected=FTDJ544YRIVLqlg3DFhg), this talk focused on the **technical challenges and complexities of implementing map services at a global scale**.\\n\\nOur goals were:\\n\\n- **Spark interest in the topic**: Show some lesser-known but fascinating aspects of these services.\xa0\\n\\n- **Highlight technical complexity**: Reveal just how intricate these technologies are, and the level of software and data engineering required.\\n\\n- **Value continuous effort**: Emphasize the ongoing work involved in maintaining, improving, and innovating within map APIs, and hint at what\u2019s coming next.\\n\\n- **Help people make better tech decisions**: Raise awareness of the variety of providers out there and improve the ability to choose the right mapping tech for future projects.\\n\\nI usually don\u2019t co-present, but after this experience, I think I should do it more often.\\n\\nThis time I really wanted it to be Juanma and me. Not just because we\u2019ve had a great relationship for years, but also because **we work at two of the most established companies in the industry** (with over 100 years of combined experience). Plus, we complement each other really well \u2014 we cover the challenges from both a software and data perspective, not just for creating, but especially for **keeping these services up to date**.\\n\\nThe feedback we received both [via the platform](https://koliseo.com/commit/commit-conf-2025/agenda/0?selected=FTDJ544YRIVLqlg3DFhg) and in the hallways was excellent. In short:\\n\\n- **What worked well**:\\n\\n  - People loved the content and many said it surprised them.\\n\\n  - Several folks mentioned they had never stopped to consider the technical complexity behind these services.\\n\\n  - Visual examples were especially appreciated \u2014 they helped people understand the concepts and challenges better.\\n\\n- **Areas for improvement**:\\n\\n  - Consider the timing (it was the last talk of the day) and adjust pacing and depth accordingly.\\n\\n  - Break the session into multiple parts next time to go into more detail.\\n\\nQuite a few people told us they were feeling tired as it was the final talk of the day. Even so, the response was very positive ([we scored 4.5 out of 5](https://koliseo.com/commit/commit-conf-2025/agenda/0?selected=FTDJ544YRIVLqlg3DFhg)), despite the **very fast pace** (around **33 seconds per slide on average** \ud83d\ude05).\\n\\nYou can find the [presentation here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_4gg8vOFTnsIdni6BiXHVsRsicvyEgqoc7FyUZfHULA/edit?usp=sharing) (in Spanish):\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<iframe src=\\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTLSJHJBwpj2JQedBA0F76176NBp0JDTm85HruL_V26L8YMcOMYLGN0p16bOf1NPeQz01YrDjFp-wCj/pubembed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" style={{width: \'560px\', minHeight: \'315px\'}} allowfullscreen=\\"true\\" mozallowfullscreen=\\"true\\" webkitallowfullscreen=\\"true\\"></iframe>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nAnd the recording is available [on Commit Conf\u2019s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJeaCw-2XAo&list=PLu976vDeELBpPE-yGv-7UARPYXkXoK7Qs&index=49&ab_channel=CommitConf)  (also in Spanish, but you can activate English subtitles \ud83e\udd37):\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qJeaCw-2XAo\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n## Reconnecting with Communities\\n\\nAnother reason I love Commit is that it brings together a lot of us who organize and run tech communities.\\n\\nFor the third year in a row, the organizers accepted our *Open Spaces* proposal, which is always a great opportunity to meet new people and learn from their experiences.\\n\\n> **Note**: In case you didn\u2019t know, the \u201cmeta-community\u201d we launched last year \u2014 [Community Builders](https://github.com/ComBuildersES) \u2014 was born from the idea of keeping these kinds of conversations going after events like this. \ud83d\ude0d\\n\\n![Collage of community meetups](/img/blogs/commit-conf-2025-recap/commit-conf-2025-collage-encuentro-con-comunidades.webp)  \\n\\nWe even recorded audio from the *open space* session, and [shared the materials and notes here](https://github.com/orgs/ComBuildersES/discussions/31) (again, everything is in Spanish \ud83d\ude05).\xa0\\n\\nAt the closing session, I was invited onstage with the other communities to introduce each one. I took the chance to briefly explain what Community Builders is.\\n\\nTo wrap up, we had a post-conference dinner at [Casa Mingo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/amaE6gXQ8ZPS4sUs8), where [\xc1lvaro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alvarosaugar/) and I brought together around 20 people who help run communities (including some who couldn\u2019t attend the conference). A perfect way to end the event.\\n\\nNo doubt about it \u2014 these activities help us connect on a human level, something much harder to achieve remotely. **Bonds are formed, relationships are strengthened, and there\'s a real sense of closeness that just doesn\u2019t translate through video calls**.\\n\\n## Lessons Learned About AI\\n\\nNo offense to the other topics (there were some excellent talks, many of which are now on YouTube), but this year\u2019s big star was AI. Of the 70 sessions, 17 focused on it \u2014 so pretty much at any given time, you could find a talk on Machine Learning or LLMs.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a quick rundown of themes and the interest I observed:\\n\\n- **Practical AI integration in real-world apps**  \\nPeople are eager to understand how to embed AI into existing apps using commercial or open-source models without switching tech stacks.\\n\\n- **Autonomous AI agent development**  \\nHigh curiosity around building agents that can learn and act on their own.\\n\\n- **Security and auditing in generative models (LLMs)**  \\nRising concern over the risks of generative AI \u2014 from running unknown code to accidentally introducing vulnerabilities. There\'s growing demand for tools that provide auditing and control.\\n\\n- **Observability and performance (in production)**  \\nMore and more interest in understanding LLM behavior in real time, with tools that offer metrics, logs, and traces to improve stability and performance.\\n\\n- **Advancements in RAG architectures (RAG 2.0)**  \\nCuriosity around new variants that improve contextual retrieval.\\n\\n- **AI on mobile devices**  \\nModerate interest in running AI directly on phones without relying on the cloud.\\n\\n- **AI applications in real-world scenarios**  \\nLess buzz overall, but still some interest in learning about how AI is being used in everyday situations.\\n\\nI also had a bunch of hallway conversations worth sharing:\\n\\n- AI is replacing traditional platforms like Stack Overflow, Reddit, and Google Search for developers \u2014 tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Cursor.ai](http://cursor.ai), and [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/editor) are seen as faster, more tailored, and more efficient.\\n\\n  - **My takeaway**: How will this affect [traditional educational channels](https://www.rauljimenez.info/es/docs/developers/educational-developers-channels)?\\n\\n- *Vibe coding* seems to be mostly well-received \u2014 as long as it\'s for small utilities, side projects, or low-risk tools (e.g., a command-line client for an API).\\n\\n- AI-assisted coding is becoming widespread (even among senior devs), often used for inspiration or to explore alternatives \u2014 though the code is always double-checked.\\n\\n- Some people pointed out how tempting it is to use AI with unfamiliar tech \u2014 the danger being that you may not catch mistakes or bad practices in the generated code.\\n\\n- [Jon Vila](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanvila/) shared a great insight: **the risk of empowering less technical roles**, like product managers, who start generating code with AI and then challenge development estimates.\\n\\n- AI is creeping into every phase of software development \u2014 from writing tests and documentation to generating test data and even creating pull requests.\\n\\n- People are really interested in tools like:\\n\\n  - **AI-powered IDEs**: [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/editor)  \\n  - **Coding assistants and autocomplete**: [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/cody)  \\n  - **Agent/LLM frameworks**: [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)  \\n  - **LLM APIs**: [GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4), [Claude 3](https://www.anthropic.com/api), [LLaMA 2](https://www.llama.com/products/llama-api/)  \\n  - **Workflow automation**: [n8n](https://n8n.io/), [Langflow](https://www.langflow.org/)  \\n  - **UI/component generators**: [Vercel V0](https://vercel.com/blog/announcing-v0-generative-ui), [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)\\n\\n## Final Thoughts\\n\\nAs long as I can, I\u2019ll keep going to Commit \u2014 because to me, it\u2019s one of those rare events where you learn, connect, and leave with a full dose of community spirit. It\u2019s intense, sure, but it\u2019s an event where:\\n\\n- You learn a ton (in talks and in the hallways)\\n- You meet new people\\n- You reconnect with old friends\\n- And it\u2019s a meeting point for tons of tech communities\\n\\nThanks, thanks, and a thousand thanks to [Laura](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lauravignali/), [Abraham](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abraham-otero-b483637/), [Nacho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/icoloma/), [Kini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kinisoftware/), and all the volunteers and [sponsors](https://2025.commit-conf.com/es/sponsors/) who made this event possible once again.\\n\\nIf you\u2019re still hungry for more, check out the piece I wrote last year: [Why Attend Developer Conferences](https://www.esri.com/en-us/software-engineeri)"},{"id":"dad-learn-to-speak-up-without-fear","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/dad-learn-to-speak-up-without-fear","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2025-05-29/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-05-29/index.md","title":"\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Dad learns to speak up without fear","description":"A personal reflection on the value of speaking sincerely, connecting beyond differences, and leading by example in a polarized world.","date":"2025-05-29T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 29, 2025","tags":[{"label":"parenting","permalink":"/blog/tags/parenting"},{"label":"self-reflection","permalink":"/blog/tags/self-reflection"}],"readingTime":4.365,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Raul Jimenez Ortega","title":"Principal Product Engineer, DevRel @ Esri","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimenezortegaraul/","socials":{"x":"hhkaos","github":"hhkaos"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/hhkaos.png","key":"hhkaos"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"dad-learn-to-speak-up-without-fear","title":"\ud83d\udde3\ufe0f Dad learns to speak up without fear","description":"A personal reflection on the value of speaking sincerely, connecting beyond differences, and leading by example in a polarized world.","authors":["hhkaos"],"image":"/img/blogs/dad-learn-to-speak-up-without-fear.webp","tags":["parenting","self-reflection"],"unlisted":true,"enableComments":true},"prevItem":{"title":"\ud83e\udd29 My Experience at Commit Conf 2025","permalink":"/blog/commit-conf-2025-recap"},"nextItem":{"title":"\ud83e\udd64 We created a soda machine","permalink":"/blog/we-created-a-soda-machine"}},"content":"For much of my life, I\u2019ve avoided sharing my opinions in public on controversial topics. Not because I don\u2019t have any (I do, sometimes contradictory, politically incorrect, or evolving), but because I\u2019ve been afraid of being misunderstood, judged, disliked, or disappointing people.\\n\\n## What I struggle with\\n\\nI\u2019ve always felt uncomfortable with conflict. I\u2019ve never liked picking sides or arguing about who\u2019s right. I think I\u2019ve tried to get along with everyone, often avoiding confrontation.\\n\\nMaybe that\u2019s why I\u2019ve stayed quiet at times when sharing my thoughts could have brought value (even if it was uncomfortable).\\n\\nWhile reflecting on this, I remembered something my dad used to tell me when I was a kid:\\n\\n> \\"_Ra\xfal, you should have friends even in hell._\\" \ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udd25\\n\\nIt\u2019s actually a pretty good piece of advice, though maybe I took it a bit too seriously. Or just misunderstood it \ud83e\udd37.\\n\\n## What got me thinking\\n\\nNot long ago, I had a conversation with [Francesc Puigvert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesc-puigvert-pell-905a8847/?originalSubdomain=es) that made me realize I\u2019ve never really experienced the kind of \u201chealthy rivalry\u201d many people feel around football/soccer (since I\u2019m not into it \ud83d\ude05). I\u2019m not used to choosing sides. I shy away from confrontation.\\n\\nThinking it through, I came to a tough realization:  \\nSilencing my opinions isn\u2019t just a disservice to myself, it\u2019s also, in part, **cowardice**. And more importantly, it\u2019s **not the example I want to set for my kids**.\\n\\n## A controversial opinion\\n\\nSo this time, I\u2019m going to be braver and share one of my \u201ccontroversial\u201d opinions (respectfully):\\n\\nI believe in equality between men and women, and I believe feminism has been, and continues to be, necessary. But I also think that some aspects of modern feminism have strayed from the original goal of equality.\\n\\n**This is hard for me to say publicly**, because I feel it\u2019s one of those \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d views that some might misinterpret as sexism.\\n\\nWhenever I\u2019ve shared this opinion with close friends, the response is almost always the same:\\n\\n> \\"_Ra\xfal, you\u2019re not a beer \ud83c\udf7a. You can\u2019t please everyone._\\" \ud83d\ude02\\n\\n## What I\u2019ve learned\\n\\nI am who I am because of my experiences (just like everyone else). But I\u2019ve learned that it\u2019s **important to express my ideas and opinions** (with respect).\\n\\nFortunately, I don\u2019t consider myself someone with fixed dogmas. What I believe today might shift tomorrow. I enjoy hearing solid arguments. I enjoy learning from people who see things differently. And when I share an opinion, **it\u2019s not because I think I hold the ultimate truth**, but because I want others to understand me better, so we can understand each other better.\\n\\n## What I want to teach my kids\\n\\nI\u2019m also writing this because I want to lead by example. I want my kids to learn the same lessons I try to teach them with words:\\n\\n- **They should be assertive**, and not be afraid to express what they think, feel, or need, clearly and respectfully, without attacking others and without letting anyone disrespect them.\\n    \\n- **They should listen to, respect, and tolerate** people who think differently, even if they disagree.\\n    \\n- **Changing your mind isn\u2019t a weakness; it\u2019s a sign of maturity and intelligence.**\\n    \\n- **You can have a deep friendship with someone who sees the world completely differently.**\\n    \\n\\nAnd I say this because I live it (and I\u2019m sure you do too \ud83d\ude09).\\n\\nMany of the people I\u2019m closest to hold opinions that are completely different from mine (on politics, religion, etc.), but that doesn\u2019t stop us from loving each other.\\n\\nBecause a true friend is someone who really knows you, loves you for who you are (including your quirks), and even if they don\u2019t always agree with you, they respect you, care about you, and are there when you need them.\\n\\n## What I\'m committing to\\n\\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve decided to be more open, even in public. So people can get to know me better. And with a bit of luck, this will help me build more meaningful friendships.\\n\\nYes, some of my ideas might sound strange, naive, politically incorrect, or even uncomfortable. But all I want is **to talk about them openly and respectfully**, not to convince anyone, just so people can understand me a little better.\\n\\n> **Mental note \ud83e\udde0:** If someone can\u2019t appreciate me because we think differently... maybe it\u2019s just not worth wasting time on, right? \ud83e\udd37\\n\\nIf we want a better society, we need to show up as we are, listen more, judge less, and be more tolerant. If we only surround ourselves with people who think like us, we\u2019re headed toward a more polarized and divided world. And that helps **no one**.\\n\\n## To wrap up\\n\\nI\u2019m still reflecting on my thoughts and ideas, and I hope to keep writing and sharing them here soon.\\n\\nAnd if I ever say or do something you don\u2019t agree with or don\u2019t understand, I genuinely invite you to tell me (with kindness \ud83d\ude09). Really. Over a beer if needed... or a soft drink. I\u2019ve come to accept not everyone likes \ud83c\udf7a \ud83d\ude1c.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**What about you?** Is there an opinion you\u2019ve kept to yourself for fear of not fitting in?  \\nHow do you deal with it? I hope I\u2019m not the only one \ud83d\ude05."},{"id":"we-created-a-soda-machine","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/we-created-a-soda-machine","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2025-02-09/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-09/index.md","title":"\ud83e\udd64 We created a soda machine","description":"In this tutorial, Jos\xe9 and I show you how to create your own soda machine.

After all the waiting... he was already impatient to try his new machine.\\n:::\\n\\nWith that said, in this article, we will share: our experience, the materials and tools used, and the steps we followed, for those of you who want to recreate it at home.\\n\\n:::note\\nYou could say that we used [project-based learning (PBL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project-based_learning) to **spend time as a family and create something cool while learning and having fun**.\\n:::\\n\\nAlthough initially, the idea was for Jos\xe9 to learn basic concepts of **electricity and physics**, I must admit that I also refreshed and learned things I had forgotten.\\n\\n## What We Learned\\n\\nThrough this project, we covered many concepts about:\\n\\n* \u26a1 **Basic Electricity**:\\n  * What electricity is and what it is used for.\\n  * Some ways to generate it.\\n  * Storage and transportation methods.\\n  * Types of electricity: static and dynamic.\\n  * What atoms are, positive charges (protons), and negative charges (electrons).\\n  * Electrical units: volts, amperes, ohms, and watts.\\n  * Differences between battery types: shapes, sizes, rechargeable vs. non-rechargeable.\\n  * What an electrical circuit is.\\n  * What a power source, supply, or battery is.\\n  * Conductive and insulating materials.\\n  * AC vs. DC current.\\n  * The purpose of chargers and transformers.\\n  * How to graphically represent an electrical circuit with basic components.\\n  * How to select the proper voltage and wire gauge for the circuit.\\n  * The difference between connecting batteries in series and parallel.\\n  * How to calculate the battery life of a power source.\\n\\n* \u2699\ufe0f **Basic Physics**:\\n  * What a pneumatic pressure extraction system is.\\n  * Basic concepts of how pressure works.\\n  * How an air pump functions.\\n\\n* \ud83d\udce6 **Other Skills**:\\n  * Learning the names of various materials.\\n  * Using different work tools.\\n  * The approximate price of various materials.\\n  * Basic notions of product design.\\n\\n## Before You Start\\n\\n:::caution Disclaimer\\nThis tutorial **must be carried out under constant adult supervision**. It is meant to be educational and fun, but accidents can happen if tools and materials are not used carefully.\\n\\nTherefore, **we assume no responsibility for any accidents, injuries, or damages that may occur during the construction or use of this machine**.\\n:::\\n\\n## Requirements\\n\\nLet\'s start by reviewing the [knowledge](#knowledge), [time](#time), [materials](#materials), and [tools](#tools) you will need.\\n\\n### Knowledge\\n\\nDo you need to be handy to follow this tutorial?

Once you have all the materials, **it took us about 6 hours to make our machine**, but:\\n1. A lot of time was spent designing the cardboard templates. We are providing you with a template with measurements.\\n2. We wasted time making and remaking some electrical connections. By following this tutorial\u2019s step-by-step process, you won\u2019t have the same issue.\\n\\nWe estimate that **it should take about 3 to 4 hours**.\\n\\n### Materials\\n\\nRegarding materials, the ones we recommend here don\u2019t match exactly with the machine we made (as seen in the photos).\\n\\nInstead, this article suggests the materials we would buy today based on our [lessons learned](#lessons-learned).\\n\\nThe **estimated budget for materials** is around **\u20ac35**.

But if you prefer, you can check them at the end.\\n\\n### 1) Structure\\n\\nYou will start by building the cardboard structure, which consists of three pieces.\\n\\n:::info TO MAKE THE STRUCTURE YOU WILL NEED\\n\\n**Approximate time**: 1 hour.\\n\\n**Tools**:\\n* Scissors or cutter.\\n* Ruler (or measuring tape).\\n* Awl (optional).\\n* Set square (or something to make right angles). <br/><small>We used a large hardcover book, specifically \\"[The Very Hungry Caterpillar](https://www.amazon.es/peque%C3%B1a-oruga-glotona-Carle-Spanish/dp/8488342349/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3MBMFIIPF8YPY&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.I6crqhdXP2FVhCz1v2h9bv_gdgmANbLfiqyxmM2J4he4MJXrDCpLJHujccBY8BAPgsB1sJ9wIFxYc9UEnssBc41gV-rjh1fppmstxu9VURbCt5ZBq-kF2Iv2UVZN2FjG-5ryoTPBhbBOU8Kawh8OS-j-tpyaD_favMrAGUxwqzi1naVzGOU4bigKSvrt7XE-kWybh6PERtW93WnTIxD6tk1mwxMS9rNCCD7HezsyRlM.ElnsTZCeB2t5rlh9JDstuTnOSP994way5YRVtupCsB4&dib_tag=se&keywords=la+peque%C3%B1a+oruga+glotona&qid=1738476996&s=books&sprefix=la+peque%C3%B1a+%2Cstripbooks%2C124&sr=1-1)\\" \ud83d\ude02.</small>\\n\\n**Materials**:\\n* Cardboard to make three pieces: one of 140cm x 60cm, and two of 46cm x ~36cm.\\n* Packing tape.\\n* 3 push buttons.\\n* ~20 paper fasteners (optional).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n**MAIN PIECE**\\n\\nStart by taking a piece of cardboard that you can cut into a **rectangular shape of 140cm x 60cm**. Ideally without folds, but if it has them, draw the template on the cardboard and try to align the folds with those shown in the image:\\n\\n[![Soda box template](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/plantilla-caja-refrescos-principal-clara.png)](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/plantilla-caja-refrescos-principal-clara.png)\\n\\nThe folds should be at the following distances from the origin: 30cm, 70cm, 85cm, 110cm, and 125cm.\\n\\nNext, cut the cardboard with scissors or a cutter, and then make the folds. To ensure that the fold is perpendicular to the cardboard\'s edge, use any sturdy, straight object like a set square, a hardcover book, etc.\\n\\n:::info\\nAfter making the folds, do not glue anything yet, as this part will be the lid that must remain open later to insert the drinks.\\n:::\\n\\n**SIDE PANELS**\\n\\nNext, you will make the two side pieces that will help the structure maintain the desired shape.\\n\\nCut two pieces of cardboard with the shape and dimensions shown in the first image:\\n\\n[![Soda box template](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/plantilla-caja-refrescos-lateral.png)](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/plantilla-caja-refrescos-lateral.png)\\n\\nOnce done, you need to make a small cut along the red dotted line and then fold the blue tabs (6cm) that will serve as reinforcements. To ensure straight folds, you can use a ruler or book.\\n\\nNow, join the three pieces, placing the tabs inside the main piece, and secure them with packing tape to hold the shape.\\n\\n:::tip Recommendation\\nOptionally, if you want, you can reinforce the connection of the three pieces by making small holes and using paper fasteners as shown below:\\n\\n[![Soda box template](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/sujetadores.png)](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/sujetadores.png)\\n\\n**Note**: We added them a few days later \ud83d\ude1c.\\n\\n:::\\n\\nTo finish the structure, use the awl (or scissors) to make **three small holes where the push buttons will be placed** on the front panel.\\n\\nIf you want them to be evenly spaced and centered, they should be 15cm apart from each other and also from the sides.\\n\\nNext, unscrew and place the three push buttons on the front panel, as shown in the image:\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Soda box button openings](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/aperturas-pulsadores-de-la-caja-refrescos.png)](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/aperturas-pulsadores-de-la-caja-refrescos.png)\\n\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n\\nSimilarly, on the bottom panel and at the same distance, make three holes where the thick flexible PVC tube will later be placed. But before doing so, I recommend covering that cardboard with packing tape to prevent it from getting wet when inserting and removing the PVC tubes.\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Sealed cap photo](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/aperturas-de-la-caja-refrescos-y-tubo.png)](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/aperturas-de-la-caja-refrescos-y-tubo.png)\\n\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n\\n:::tip ANOTHER TIP\\nUse scissors or something similar to enlarge the hole gradually, and keep checking with the PVC tube itself that the size is as tight as possible. You don\u2019t want the tube to move too much when dispensing the soda.\\n:::\\n\\nCongratulations, with this, you have finished making the structure!\\n\\n:::tip\\nIf you look closely, at the base where the sodas will go, the reinforcements create a small step. If you have extra cardboard, you could cut a piece to place on the base to smooth out that step; otherwise, when placing the bottles, they may be a bit unstable.\\n:::\\n\\n### 2) Circuit\\n\\nNext, you will assemble the electrical circuit that will activate a different air pump when each button is pressed.\\n\\n:::info TO MAKE THE CIRCUIT YOU WILL NEED\\n\\n**Approximate time**: 45 minutes.\\n\\n**Tools**:\\n* Needle-nose pliers or scissors.\\n\\n**Materials**:\\n* Electrical wire roll (~1.5 meters).\\n* 3 Air pumps.\\n* 4 AAA batteries.\\n* 1 Battery holder box.\\n* Electrical tape roll (not packing tape).\\n\\nAnd the three push buttons that are already installed in the structure.\\n:::\\n\\nStart by cutting the electrical wire into 9 pieces. The wire does **not** need to be black and red, but this is a good opportunity to explain that there is a [convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_wiring) where black represents the negative (-) pole and red represents the positive (+) pole in direct current circuits.\\n\\n<details><summary>\ud83d\udcda If you want to review some concepts such as: electric current, the function of conductive wires, power sources, ... expand this section.</summary>\\n<p>\\n\\nTo have everything handy, here is an index with theoretical explanations to understand everything related to the circuit\u2019s operation:\\n\\n* [What is electricity?](#what-is-electricity)\\n* [Measurement units: volts, amperes, ohms, and watts](#measurement-units-volts-amperes-ohms-and-watts)\\n* [Differences between battery types](#differences-between-battery-types)\\n  * [Alkaline vs. rechargeable batteries](#alkaline-vs-rechargeable-batteries)\\n  * [Battery shapes and sizes](#battery-shapes-and-sizes)\\n* [What is direct and alternating current?](#what-is-direct-and-alternating-current)\\n* [How to graphically represent an electrical circuit?](#how-to-graphically-represent-an-electrical-circuit)\\n* [What power source to use?](#what-power-source-to-use)\\n* [What electrical wire gauge to use?](#what-electrical-wire-gauge-to-use)\\n* [How to calculate the power source\u2019s lifespan?](#how-to-calculate-the-power-source-lifespan)\\n* [How to determine how much energy a device consumes in an hour?](#how-to-determine-how-much-energy-a-device-consumes-in-an-hour)\\n\\n</p>\\n</details>\\n\\nTo avoid excess wire and keep the power source centered, the wire lengths should be approximately:\\n\\n* 3 x 9cm (\ud83d\udd34 red)\\n* 2 x 20cm (\ud83d\udd34 red)\\n* 1 x 10cm (\ud83d\udd34 red)\\n* 2 x 15cm (\u26ab\ufe0f black)\\n* 1 x 20cm (\u26ab\ufe0f black)\\n\\nNow strip about 1cm from each wire end to make the connections.\\n\\nSince the push buttons are already installed in the structure, you will now work on the box. The first thing you need to do is place some counterweight inside, such as the beverage bottles themselves.\\n\\n:::tip Demonstration\\nStart by assembling a simple circuit for an easy demonstration.\\n\\nMake the two connections with the push button (1) and (2), between the button and the motor (3), with the motor (4), and connect wires (5) and (6) to the battery holder box (represented by a battery in the diagram).\\n\\nNow place the batteries inside the battery holder and press the button.

Only the beverage dispensers are left! \ud83e\udd73.\\n\\n:::info TO MAKE THE DISPENSERS YOU WILL NEED\\n\\n**Approximate time**: 20 minutes.\\n\\n**Materials**:\\n* 3 Flexible PVC tubes.\\n* 3 Beverage/soda bottles.\\n* 1 Hot glue stick.\\n\\n**Tools**:\\n* Scissors or cutter.\\n* Awl or knife.\\n* Needle-nose pliers (or something to widen the hole).\\n* Hot glue gun.\\n:::\\n\\nStart by cutting the two large PVC tubes (6mm-8mm) in half so you have four parts of approximately 50cm each. These will be the tubes through which the beverage will flow.\\n\\nNext, cut the small tube (4mm-5mm) into three 25cm pieces, which will be used to introduce air into the bottle.\\n\\nThen, without removing the bottles from their place, unscrew the caps. Each cap will need two holes: one for the large tube and one for the small tube.\\n\\nOur advice is to start by making a small hole with an awl, knife, small screwdriver, or something similar. Then gradually enlarge each hole until both tubes fit, **ensuring there isn\u2019t too much looseness**.\\n\\nWe first tried using a drill, but it seemed dangerous, so we switched to an awl. Then, we carefully widened the holes using the tip of needle-nose pliers until each tube could fit through.\\n\\nFinally, insert the tubes and screw the caps back onto the bottles. The thick tubes should reach the bottom of the bottles, while the thin ones should only pass through the caps.\\n\\nThen, use the hot glue gun to seal the openings, preventing air from escaping through the cap holes, like this:\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Sealed cap photo](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/botella-y-tubos-pvc-esquema-y-foto.png)](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/botella-y-tubos-pvc-esquema-y-foto.png)\\n\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n\\n### 4) Assembly\\n\\nEverything is ready for the final connections.\\n\\n:::info TO ASSEMBLE YOU WILL NEED\\n\\n**Approximate time**: 5 minutes.\\n\\n**Materials**:\\n* Electrical tape.\\n\\n**Tools**:\\n* Your hands \ud83d\ude1c.\\n:::\\n\\nNow, simply connect the thin PVC tubes to the air pump outlets as shown below:\\n\\n[![Soda machine dispenser](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/dispensador-maquina-de-refrescos.png)](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/dispensador-maquina-de-refrescos.png)\\n\\n:::caution\\nBe careful! If you connect the tube to the air **inlet** instead of the outlet, soda could enter the air pump. We say this from experience \ud83d\ude1c, so make sure it\u2019s the **outlet**. The easiest way to check is to turn on the circuit by pressing the button\u2014you\'ll feel where the air is coming out.\\n:::\\n\\nFinally, place the end of the thicker PVC tube into the hole in the cardboard box.\\n\\nAs you can see in the following photo, we decided to secure the motors to the cardboard box with electrical tape to prevent them from moving due to vibration, resulting in this setup:\\n\\n![](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/foto-tripas-maquina-de-refrescos.jpg)\\n\\nCongratulations!

If the pressure is high, the water comes out with more force. In electricity, volts represent the force pushing current through wires. A small battery has 1.5 volts (like a soft stream), while an outlet in Spain has 220 volts (like a strong jet).\\n* \ud83d\udca7 **AMPERES (A)** - Amperes measure **how much water is flowing through the pipe**. If the pipe is large and allows a lot of water through, there are many amperes. In electricity, more amperes mean more current flowing through the wire. For high-consumption appliances like an oven, proper wiring is essential to prevent overheating.\\n* **\ud83d\udea7 OHMS (\u03a9)** - Ohms are like **the resistance in a pipe**. If the hose is very narrow, water struggles to pass through. In electricity, ohms indicate how difficult it is for current to pass through a material. A copper wire has low resistance (like a wide hose), whereas a poor conductor like plastic has high resistance.\\n* \u26a1 **WATTS (W)** - Watts are like **the strength of the water coming out of a hose**. If you have high pressure (volts) and high flow (amperes), the stream will be strong and move more things. In electricity, watts indicate how much energy a device uses, such as a light bulb or motor. **They are calculated by multiplying volts \xd7 amperes**.\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Amperage Voltage Resistance Water chart](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/amperage-voltage-resistance-water-chart.png)](/img/blogs/creamos-una-maquina-de-refrescos/amperage-voltage-resistance-water-chart.png)\\n\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n\\nIt\u2019s good to know the following about these units:\\n* \ud83d\udea8 If you connect a device designed to operate at a specific voltage to a power supply with a higher voltage, you could burn it out.\\n* \ud83d\udd25 If a thin wire has to support a high current (high amperage), it will heat up a lot and may burn out.\\n* \ud83e\udeab When a battery gets depleted, its voltage drops until it can no longer properly power devices. For example, most devices stop working correctly if the battery drops below 1.1V or 1.0V. Some more demanding devices may need at least 1.2V to function correctly. So if a 1.5V battery:\\n  * Has more than 1.3V \u2192 It still has charge.\\n  * Is between 1.0V and 1.2V \u2192 It is nearly depleted.\\n  * Has less than 1.0V \u2192 It is dead.\\n\\n#### DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TYPES OF BATTERIES\\n\\n##### Alkaline vs. Rechargeable Batteries\\n\\nAlkaline and rechargeable batteries both provide energy to toys, remotes, and other devices, but they function differently.\\n\\nWhen we talk about energy, we refer to the amount of electricity required to operate over a given period. Energy is measured in watt-hours (Wh) and depends on the power of the device (W) and the time it is in use (h). For example, a remote control consumes very little energy since it only uses the battery for a few seconds when you press a button, whereas a battery-operated Scalextric track consumes much more energy because it is used more intensively.\\n\\n**Alkaline batteries are single-use**: when they run out, they must be discarded and replaced. On the other hand, rechargeable batteries can be recharged many times with a special charger, reducing the need to buy new ones frequently.\\n\\n**An important difference is the voltage**. Alkaline batteries usually have 1.5V, while most rechargeable batteries have 1.2V.\\n\\nAlthough this may seem like a small difference, as we mentioned earlier, some devices need higher voltage to function properly, meaning alkaline batteries might last longer in those cases. However, rechargeable batteries can be better for frequently used items since they can be recharged and reused multiple times.\\n\\nThus, **it\u2019s better to use alkaline batteries in devices that are used infrequently or require more voltage (higher potential difference)**, whereas **rechargeable batteries are ideal for daily-use devices that don\u2019t require high voltages to function well**, such as flashlights or remote controls. This way, you save money and help the environment by generating less waste.\\n\\n##### Battery Shapes and Sizes\\n\\nBatteries come in different shapes and sizes because each is designed for various devices and needs. The difference is not just in shape but also in voltage, capacity, and intended use.\\n\\n* **Cylindrical Batteries** (e.g., AA, AAA, AAAA, C, and D): These are the most common and have a voltage of 1.5V in alkaline versions and 1.2V in rechargeables. The difference between them lies in capacity, meaning how much energy they can store. For example, a D battery lasts much longer than a AAA because it is larger and has more capacity.\\n\\n* **Button Batteries** (such as those in watches or hearing aids): These are tiny and have voltages ranging from 1.5V to 3V, depending on the type. They are used in devices that need little energy but for extended periods, such as clocks or calculators.\\n\\n* **Square and rectangular batteries**: The most common is the 9V battery, used in devices like smoke detectors or wireless microphones. These batteries can provide higher voltage because they contain multiple smaller batteries inside the casing.\\n\\nHere is an example of different battery shapes and sizes:\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n<figure>\\n <img\\n   src=\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/6_most_common_battery_types-1.jpg/800px-6_most_common_battery_types-1.jpg\\"\\n   alt=\\"6 most common battery types-1\\" />\\n <figcaption>\\n  Batteries: D, C, AA, AAA, AAAA, and 9V // Attribution: Hohum, CC BY-SA 3.0, via Wikimedia Commons.\\n </figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n</div>\\n\\n#### WHAT IS DIRECT AND ALTERNATING CURRENT?\\n\\nFor electronic devices like the one we are going to build, we will use direct current, but what exactly is that? What other types of current exist, and what are they used for?\\n\\nThere are two types of electrical current: direct current (DC) and alternating current (AC). Understanding the difference is important because each type is used in different devices and situations. Direct current is ideal for electronic devices like mobile phones, computers, and battery-powered toys, while alternating current is what powers our homes, supplying electricity for lights, appliances, and outlets.\\n\\nHere\u2019s a short but comprehensive video from \\"The Engineering Mindset\\" explaining it further:\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2jqJZxxX6gQ\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nAdditionally, using the wrong type of current can damage devices or make them malfunction, so it\u2019s crucial to understand which type is needed and how to convert one to the other if necessary.\\n\\n:::note Electrical Current Abbreviations\\n * Direct Current (DC)\\n * Alternating Current (AC)\\n:::\\n\\n#### HOW IS AN ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT GRAPHICALLY REPRESENTED?\\n\\nThis short 3-minute video by Learn Science with B, although not featuring the same components as our circuit, will help explain [the basic concepts of electrical circuit representation](https://youtu.be/xN2EGBM7HvY):\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xN2EGBM7HvY\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n#### HOW TO CALCULATE THE POWER SOURCE\'S LIFESPAN?\\n\\nNext, we will calculate the lifespan of our power source.\\n\\nWe need to consider that:\\n\\n* Standard AAA alkaline batteries have an electrical charge capacity of ~1200 mAh.\\n  * If we use rechargeable [NiMH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nickel%E2%80%93metal_hydride_battery) batteries, they usually range between 800-1000 mAh.\\n* As we saw in the [air pump specification sheet](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/S4f22c638a1574612a5fa8608ad19676fe.jpg), our 6V air pump requires a maximum of 300 mA.\\n\\nTo estimate the duration, we simply divide the capacity by the consumption.\\n\\nIf using standard alkaline batteries (1200 mAh):\\n\\n* **Duration = Capacity (mAh) / Consumption (mA) = 1200/300 = 4 hours**\\n\\nIf using NiMH rechargeable batteries (800-1000 mAh), the duration would be:\\n\\n* Duration = 800/300 = 2.6 hours\\n* Duration = 1000/300 = 3.3 hours\\n\\n#### HOW TO KNOW HOW MUCH ENERGY A DEVICE CONSUMES IN AN HOUR?\\n\\nTo calculate energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh), which is what the electricity bill measures:\\n\\nkWh = (Watts \xd7 Hours of use) / 1000\\n\\nExample: A 100W television turned on for 5 hours:\\n\\n(100W \xd7 5) / 1000 = 0.5 kWh\\n\\n### Dispensers\\n\\n#### HOW DOES THE AIR PUMP WORK?\\n\\nThe mechanism is simple:\\n\\n* The **motor spins like a wheel**. When you close the circuit and electricity flows, the motor starts spinning, just like when you pedal a bicycle and the wheels move.\\n* The motor **moves a small \\"arm\\"** that, in turn, moves flexible rubber pieces that go up and down each time the motor rotates. **This part is called a diaphragm, as it functions similarly [to the human body\'s diaphragm](https://youtu.be/Wq_bPoRTn7I?si=tVmiWPZPqq6jhpSR&t=87), which helps the lungs take in and expel air**.\\n* Air enters on one side and exits on the other. When the rubber moves up, it draws air in through a small hole. When the rubber moves down, it pushes the air out.\\n\\nThis creates a continuous airflow. Since the motor never stops spinning, the air keeps entering and exiting continuously.\\n\\nThe following video shows the inside of one of the air pumps we used for this machine:\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PvzYAqC7eCg\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\n#### WHY DOES THE LIQUID COME OUT?\\n\\nOur system uses air pressure to force the liquid out of the bottle.\\n\\nTechnically, this is called a pressure extraction mechanism, and it works as follows:\\n\\n* When the air pump is turned on, as we saw, it generates movement that allows air to enter through one nozzle and exit through another, to which a PVC tube is connected.\\n* The air flows through this tube and enters the top of the bottle through the cap.\\n* Since there is no way for the air to escape (because the cap is sealed), the pressure increases, pushing the liquid down.\\n* The only exit is through the other PVC tube (the thicker one). Since it is not sealed, the liquid is pushed out through it.\\n\\nIn short, it\'s like trying to inflate a balloon filled with water, and at the bottom of the balloon, there\'s a tiny hole through which the water exits when you blow into it.\\n\\n## Lessons Learned\\n\\nWe wanted to summarize the things we would change if we had to do the project again:\\n\\n* Be careful when folding the main box piece to ensure that no advertising is visible.\\n* Analyze the required wiring more thoroughly before purchasing.\\n* Use a AAA battery holder instead of a 9V battery.\\n* Use less packing tape and more paper fasteners.\\n* Ignore suggestions to use a drill and soldering iron (due to the potential risks).\\n* Purchase a fluid retention valve or consider adding something to catch annoying drips.\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nThis has been the first project **we have documented**, although we had done some smaller projects before.\\n\\n<details><summary>Expand if you\'re interested in seeing other things we\'ve done \ud83d\ude0a.</summary>\\n<p>\\n\\nThat I can remember right now:\\n* In 2019, when I bought the [Micro:bit kit](https://www.amazon.es/KEYESTUDIO-Sensors-Box-Starter-Micro/dp/B07GSVHWNS/ref=asc_df_B07GSVHWNS?mcid=e2fddc049e85349db2566391043bac0a&tag=googshopes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=699750830830&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=13342692338367672801&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1005407&hvtargid=pla-583389400445&psc=1&gad_source=1) for [the workshops we organized from Tomelloso Tech](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwB9KstFgABt9sFwnt_2FEdFvmB1a2i9U), we programmed the Micro:bit board to display a happy or sad face depending on whether the left or right button was pressed.\\n* In 2019, I also collaborated with [Technovation Families](https://photos.app.goo.gl/nnQvqzBFJKJQuQPQ9), although I suppose he didn\u2019t quite understand it, we [trained an AI together to recognize dogs and other things](https://www.youtube.com/@RaulJimenezOrtega/search).\\n* In 2022, we made a basic design of a [Minecraft character in Blender](https://x.com/hhkaos/status/1564189181416439815/photo/1).\\n* Last year (2024), we published his first game on his Scratch profile ([Basket pong](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/992463134/)), and also worked on OctoStudio, where I introduced him to the concept of variables for the first time.\\n* And last Christmas, we also made a mini video montage with his cousins (\\"Excursion to the Calahonda Mines\\"), in addition to assembling and programming the [mBot](https://www.amazon.es/Makeblock-programable-codificaci%C3%B3n-Educativo-Bluetooth/dp/B07XR98YYQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.rufDjeFexjuCHAVo_XrDdlFQcmxBQvzIhxdP5rOHYGzGaOiUc1XmWUgtz7vbMOu8XbEsRsvWyaxutzCKAbv9Y7GAd9OUX6O0-SvSxwm27oqL8SSXbVU2BSEGD9mBGsrKsOn_cnYi_BFxq7284vKa50-2lOiXgKXwc50GNhyKvkrGoDG2EtkvY15kvSbmv5dkUyUu4bayaMp_SoeqV90oxpg88GbtDFZ9WWm68hFxxAi0qwqlfT08lWdd715ZVRwj8B40y7_KGHcrjKi9k5oVQfkU-l7be3oW4b_dJo64ud8.YbYewLLCaZbecebntHpgkEZHY4c_r9ffyrBCfKArUx0&dib_tag=se&keywords=mBot&qid=1739063313&sr=8-1-spons&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.8f1d93f5-43fb-442d-acba-8640975a5f7e&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1) that Santa Claus brought him.\\n\\nAlthough I\u2019m sure I\u2019m forgetting some things... \ud83d\ude05\\n\\nSometimes I think about documenting previous experiences, but the truth is, work keeps piling up, and we have to decide whether to document the past or focus on the future.

I love it, that means you\'re really into this topic \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude02.\\n\\nThe root of everything I\u2019m going to share started with a proposal I received at the beginning of the school year from the guidance counselor at my children\'s school. She suggested that [the AMPA](https://www.ampanovaschoolalmeria.org/) collaborate with the school to organize an activity to educate students on AI usage. And since I\u2019m easy to convince\u2026 here I am, months later and many \\"brain cycles\\" later, sharing the progress.\\n\\nIn this article, I will talk about:\\n* **Traditional AI vs. Generative AI**: key differences.\\n* **Generative AI**: what makes it \\"special\\".\\n* **AI in education**: the current situation as I see it.\\n* **My contribution**: a new project I\u2019ve embarked on.\\n* **Protecting ourselves from the hype**: my advice to avoid falling for misinformation.\\n\\n## Traditional vs. GenAI\\n\\nAs we know, AI is not new<sup>*</sup>. It has been used in search engines, recommendation engines (Netflix, social media, ...), virtual assistants (Google Home, Siri, Alexa, ...), automatic translators, facial recognition, spam filters, text predictors, CAPTCHAs, etc.\\n\\n:::tip \ud83e\udde0 Did you know...\\nThe [Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence (AEPIA)](https://www.aepia.org/historia_aepia/) was founded in 1984?\\n:::\\n\\nHowever, that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that generative AI has arrived with incredible momentum, and it\u2019s now \u201ceverywhere.\u201d\\n\\nThe following table summarizes some key differences:\\n\\n|Aspect|Traditional AI|Generative AI|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|**Purpose**|Analyze, predict, and/or classify|Create and generate \\"original\\" content|\\n|**Work model**|Based on specific rules|Contextual understanding-based|\\n|**Training data**|Structured and/or labeled data (by humans)|Large volumes of diverse data|\\n|**Tasks**|Solving specific problems|Creative and adaptive tasks|\\n|**Dependency on past data**|High, based on previous patterns|Lower, capable of innovating and creating new things|\\n\\n## Generative AI\\n\\nBut why give it so much importance? What makes generative AI different from other disruptive technologies? Or as Bugs Bunny would say, [What\'s up, doc?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUuo3PhoXs0&ab_channel=ThemeSongGuy).\\n\\nThere have been many other technological advances that have had a radical impact on humanity and transformed us: the printing press, the steam engine, electricity, the Internet...\\n\\nHowever, in recent years, we\u2019ve seen an increase in the speed at which these changes occur, likely due to globalization and new communication technologies.\\n\\nThe following chart from *Harvard Business Review* illustrates how the time needed to adopt new technologies has decreased over the years, based on data from the United States:\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n![](https://hbr.org/resources/images/article_assets/2013/11/FELTON-CONSUMPTION-.png)\\n\\n<figcaption>The Pace of Technology Adoption is Speeding Up, Image Harvard Business Review</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\nAlthough I have not yet found highly reliable data on the adoption of generative AI tools, we\u2019ve heard that ChatGPT (launched in 2022) has already reached an incredible [300 million **weekly** active users](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/4/24313097/chatgpt-300-million-weekly-users).\\n\\nTo put this number into context, here\u2019s a comparison showing other well-known applications and how long they took to reach 100 million **monthly** active users:\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n  \\n  <img src=\\"https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/ChatGPT_A20Blockbuster_pages-to-jpg-0002-min.jpg?im=Resize,width=360,aspect=fit,type=normal)\\" />\\n\\n  <figcaption>Source: <a href=\\"https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-for-fastest-growing-user-base-says-study-15840751.htm\\">CNBC TV18</a>, data provided by <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarweb\\">Similar Web</a></figcaption>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nFor me, the importance isn\u2019t just in the speed of adoption. What concerns me is that it is being used massively without a solid knowledge base, leading to content being generated and shared that appears to be high quality, but often are not.\\n\\nUnlike widely used tools like Word or Excel, which require some training and come with an instruction manual, **most AI tools do not provide clear guidelines**.\\n\\nFurthermore, they are so intuitive that anyone can enter a request and receive a response. However, what a new user might not realize is that if the request is not well defined, if they are unaware of the types of instructions AI can process, its limitations, biases, and other key characteristics, the chances of getting an inaccurate or misleading answer are significantly high.\\n\\nAnd one of the biggest problems is that **there are still aspects of generative AI that even its own creators don\u2019t fully understand**, such as how exactly prompts, meaning input instructions, influence responses.\\n\\nUltimately, this puts us in a situation where, [as Ram\xf3n Beson\xedas says](https://youtu.be/KRIeyKi9bXw?si=Oz4YJDYZtQawecTI&t=137):\\n* **Everyone is a novice** when it comes to using AI (even its creators), with some of us having a few more months of experience than others.\\n* **There is still no clear methodology on how to teach AI.**\\n\\nThis is why I believe it is especially important for adults to gain a basic understanding, experiment with AI, and do their best to stay up to date\u2014understanding how it can be used and sharing both good and bad experiences with others.\\n\\n:::note We Live in Exponential Times\\nThe first time I heard the phrase \\"we live in exponential times\\" was when I watched the video [\\"Did You Know\\" (2008)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL9Wu2kWwSY&ab_channel=AmybethQuinn). A quote that stuck with me was: \\"**We are preparing students for jobs that do not yet exist**,\\" and these jobs will be highly demanded in just a few years. \\n\\nI couldn\u2019t agree more. If this felt accurate to me back then, 17 years ago, it\u2019s even clearer now that this exponential growth hasn\u2019t slowed down. And maybe it\u2019s just me, but at times, it\u2019s almost dizzying.\\n:::\\n\\n## AI in Education\\n\\nThere are many debates around AI: intellectual property, ethics, regulation, job displacement... But what I take for granted is that this technology is here to stay, that **it is already redefining education and learning**, and that those who can use it correctly will have an advantage and stand out.\\n\\nDid you know that according to [a survey by Statista](https://www.statista.com/chart/29244/number-of-companies-using-open-ai-in-their-business-processes-worldwide/), the education sector could be the second most impacted by this technology? Below is an infographic with the results:\\n\\n![](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/29244.jpeg)\\n\\nBut it\u2019s not just educators using it\u2014**students are also leveraging AI to do their work for them** (surprise!! \ud83d\ude1c).\\n\\nBut you know what? I don\u2019t blame them. One of AI\u2019s promises is that it helps us with tasks we don\u2019t like or find less important. And I think that, deep down, even if we don\u2019t admit it, many adults started using AI for the same reason.\\n\\nThe biggest issue I\u2019ve encountered, however, is that even if you try to find it, **there is no good content**<sup>*</sup> to guide how AI should be used **for studying**\u2014meaning content that is accessible, comprehensive, structured, high-quality, and free.\\n\\n:::note\\nOr at least I haven\u2019t found it. I\u2019m looking for resources that explain how to use AI correctly for studying, developing new skills, improving cognitive development, strengthening critical thinking, boosting creativity, increasing productivity... If you know of any, please leave them in [the comments](#comments) \ud83d\ude4f\ud83d\ude0a.\\n:::\\n\\nIt\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that **we will need to develop new skills**.\\n\\nJust as the advent of computing, the Internet, and search engines required us to develop new skills\u2014such as knowing how to search online\u2014now, it will be more important than ever to enhance other competencies, such as language skills and critical thinking, to make good use of generative AI.\\n\\nFor example, we will need to understand the differences between various AI tools and models at a high level or learn how to craft effective prompts to get useful results.\\n\\nAnd while I hope this won\u2019t happen, if we don\u2019t develop these skills, I fear society could face a [dystopian](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/dystopia_n?tl=true) future where new generations are less prepared and surrounded by misinformation that is difficult to identify.\\n\\nThat\u2019s why **we must use this technology as just another tool** to assist us in our work and skill development\u2014not misuse it in a way that hinders our growth and intelligence.\\n\\nRepeatedly, it\u2019s clear that AI, like anything else, can do great things if used well, but it can also create problems if misused.\\n\\n:::tip Evaluate Your AI Usage\\nHow do you use AI? Here\u2019s [an article](https://iaenlasaulas-blogspot-com.translate.goog/2024/05/como-utilizas-la-ia-una-guia-para.html?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp) and [a self-evaluation sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n4niqCscrMkHQWcm0cTpJ3rhQgFqe1OZgbZRP2iutwM/edit?usp=sharing) \ud83d\ude09. I agree with Ram\xf3n Beson\xedas that ideally, most of the times you should score between 70% and 90%.\\n:::\\n\\n## My Contribution\\n\\nYou might be wondering, after all this discussion, what am I doing to address this issue?\\n\\nBeyond doing my best to educate my children at home and support their school, I\u2019ve embarked on a new documentation project in the section \\"[My Digital Brain > Artificial Intelligence](/docs/digital-brain).\\"\\n\\nSince I\u2019m neither a teacher nor an AI expert, I\u2019ve reached out for help through interviews with [teachers in Spain, AI specialists, and experts in related fields](https://www-rauljimenez-info.translate.goog/es/docs/artificial-intelligence/education-ai?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp#agradecimientos) to gather information on this topic: ideas, experiences, resources, insights, etc.\\n\\n:::note\\nIf you know someone who I should definitely interview, please ask her/him to reach out to me through [any of my channels](/).\\n:::\\n\\nThe goal is to create educational material that fills the gap I found. Content on how to use AI (for students) with a holistic approach that is accessible, structured, comprehensive, high-quality, and free. I hope this resource will not only support the activities we are organizing at our Parents\' Association but also be useful for other educational communities.\\n\\nFor now, just can find the working doc in Spanish: [Using AI in Education](https://www.rauljimenez.info/es/docs/artificial-intelligence/education-ai#agradecimientos), but I encourage you to check the following resource:\\n\\n<Button label=\\"Using AI in Education (Google\'s translated version)\\" link=\\"https://www-rauljimenez-info.translate.goog/es/docs/artificial-intelligence/education-ai?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp\\" block />\\n\\n## Protect Yourself from the \\"Hype\\"\\n\\nWe can\'t deny that although AI has great potential, the \\"[hype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle)\\" surrounding it is overwhelming.\\n\\nEvery technological innovation brings this effect, as shown in the following graph, which you can find in all \\"*Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies*\\" reports:\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<figure>\\n <img\\n   src=\\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg/320px-Gartner_Hype_Cycle.svg.png\\"\\n   alt=\\"Hype cycle\\" />\\n <figcaption>Hype cycle, Image by Jeremykemp, Wikipedia</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nBut let\u2019s not forget why this happens. It\u2019s a mix of:\\n* The optimism and passion of some innovators.\\n* The eagerness of many people to believe in it.\\n* The vast media attention and publicity.\\n* The \\"hidden\\" (economic) interests of the companies behind these innovations, competing non-stop to lead these revolutions.\\n\\nThis often leads to inflated expectations, sometimes at the cost of spreading misleading information. \\n\\nTo protect yourself from manipulation and misinformation, not just about AI, I recommend:\\n\\n1. **Be wary of emotional language:** Anything that sounds too good to be true, exaggerated promises, or alarmist headlines. These are usually signs of manipulation. By the way, this applies to everything.\\n2. **Be critical:** Evaluate the source of the information and check for economic interests.\\n3. **Do your research:** Look for expert opinions and reliable sources.\\n4. **Diversify your sources:** Consult multiple perspectives for a more complete view.\\n\\n:::tip Who Has Economic Interests?\\n**Companies**. The biggest stakeholders are the companies providing the technology driving this innovation, such as OpenAI, NVIDIA, Microsoft, Amazon (AWS), Meta, etc. These publicly traded companies need to maintain and increase their stock value, and many do so by making announcements that fuel the \\"hype.\\"\\n\\n**Content creators** who make money through ads or affiliate links, like news media, YouTubers, Instagram influencers, TikTokers, etc.\\n:::\\n\\nWell, what do you think? What do you disagree with? What am I missing? Or did you find it interesting?\\n\\n## Comments"},{"id":"the-rise-of-online-communities","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the-rise-of-online-communities","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2024-07-07/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-07/index.md","title":"2\ufe0f\u20e3 [1992-2003] The rise of online communities","description":"\u26a0\ufe0f Notices and acknowledgments","date":"2024-07-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 7, 2024","tags":[{"label":"history","permalink":"/blog/tags/history"},{"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"label":"online communities","permalink":"/blog/tags/online-communities"},{"label":"tech community","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-community"},{"label":"meetups","permalink":"/blog/tags/meetups"},{"label":"spain","permalink":"/blog/tags/spain"}],"readingTime":12.57,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Raul Jimenez Ortega","title":"Principal Product Engineer, DevRel @ Esri","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimenezortegaraul/","socials":{"x":"hhkaos","github":"hhkaos"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/hhkaos.png","key":"hhkaos"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"the-rise-of-online-communities","title":"2\ufe0f\u20e3 [1992-2003] The rise of online communities","authors":["hhkaos"],"tags":["history","community","online communities","tech community","meetups","spain"],"enableComments":true},"prevItem":{"title":"\ud83c\udf93 AI and education, a holistic approach","permalink":"/blog/ai-and-education-a-holistic-approach"},"nextItem":{"title":"1\ufe0f\u20e3 [1975-1991] First associations and online communities","permalink":"/blog/first-associations-and-online-communities"}},"content":"<details><summary>\u26a0\ufe0f <strong>Notices and acknowledgments</strong></summary>\\n<p>\\nI would like to start by clarifying that:\\n\\n- This article will be completely biased by [my own life experience](https://www.rauljimenez.info/docs/about-me/my-journey) (as a Spaniard and because of my environment).\\n- It may contain gaps and errors.\\n- I appreciate all contributions, which of course will be acknowledged and will be under [CC Attribution 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\\n\\n**Acknowledgments**: to [JJ Merelo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-j-merelo-0815/), and [Jos\xe9 Luis Orihuela](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jlori/) for their contributions and resources.  \\n</p>\\n</details>\\n\\nThis is the second article in the series \\"[History of Technical Communities](../2024-07-05/index.md),\\" in which we are reviewing the history of technical communities in Spain. In this one, we will focus specifically on the era when the Internet became popular, reaching many households, and we will continue to get nostalgic with some of the innovations that were introduced.\\n\\nWe are in the years of:\\n* The [Barcelona Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics).\\n* The [Seville Expo \'92](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville_Expo_%2792).\\n* The celebration of the first Meeting of Students of Technical and Higher Engineering in Computer Sciences ([RITSI](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuni%C3%B3n_de_Estudiantes_de_Ingenier%C3%ADas_T%C3%A9cnicas_y_Superiores_en_Inform%C3%A1tica)).\\n* The launch of [Windows 3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1).\\n\\nAnd a year before [Intel Pentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium) began flooding the market (1993).\\n\\n:::note\\nOn the radio, and in our [Discman](https://www.xataka.com/musica/cuando-el-discman-mp3-conquisto-brevemente-nuestras-vidas), songs like \\"Experiencia Religiosa\\" by Enrique Iglesias (1995), \\"Wannabe\\" by the Spice Girls (1996), \\"La Raja de Tu Falda\\" by Estopa (1999), or \\"Livin\' la Vida Loca\\" by Ricky Martin were playing.\\n:::\\n\\n## Linux and LUGs\\n\\nA year earlier, in 1991, the [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) operating system was created, which in 1992 adopted a GPL license. This technology not only transformed the Internet and many other things, but it was also the seed of many important communities of the time, such as the [**Linux user groups**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_user_group) (**LUGs**). Among other things, they held \u201c*Linux install parties*\u201d to help install systems like SUSE (1992), Debian (1993), Red Hat (1993), Mandrake (1998), ... which were not easy to get working at that time.\\n\\nYears later, in ~1997, the **Association of Spanish Linux Users** ([Hispalinux](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispalinux)) was formed in Spain, an important community whose goals can be read in [their statutes](https://hispalinux.es/Estatutos). In 2024 it has more than 7,000 members.\\n\\n## Internet\\n\\nThis is the era of the [early days of the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAME#Evolution) [in Spain (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIuLQACGiaI), when Web 1.0 arrives, static pages created with HTML 2.0, practically without user systems or comments, and which we browse with browsers like [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape) or [Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)).\\n\\n:::note\\nDue to the limitations of JavaScript in 1996, there were technologies like Microsoft\'s [ActiveX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX), Sun Microsystems\' [JavaBeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans), and [Macromedia Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), which allowed for more advanced experiences.\\n:::\\n\\nThe first Spanish [Internet Service Providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) like [Goya](https://www.eldiario.es/hojaderouter/internet/goya-servicios-telematicos-internet-upm-eunet-rediris_1_3845405.html) (1992) and [InfoV\xeda](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfoV%C3%ADa) (1995) were born, charging for Internet (per minute connected) at the price of a local phone call. Yes, because at that time, you had to pay for local calls. That\'s when 28.8 kbps modems, **the routers of that time, were more than a thousand times slower than today\'s**.\\n\\nWith these connections, we could chat and browse Web. At that time, websites almost had no images, and of course, no multimedia files, because downloading a 4 MB file could take many hours, and if you were lucky that someone didn\'t cut off your connection by calling your house.\\n\\n:::note\\nSoon after, audio and video compression algorithms, or [audio codecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_codecs) and [video codecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_video_codecs#Codecs_list) improved significantly, facilitating access to these files online (e.g. MP3 1993, AAC 1997, DivX 1998, MP4 2001, ...).\\n:::\\n\\nAlso in 1992, [party lines](https://www.xataka.com/historia-tecnologica/una-historia-de-pioneros-ya-ligaban-discutian-y-daban-likes-en-las-party-lines-de-los-90) emerged, multi-conferences with strangers via telephone. Although personally, I wouldn\'t include this in the community initiatives.\\n\\nIn 1998, another community was born, the **[Association of Internauts](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asociaci%C3%B3n_de_Internautas)**, whose [can be read here](https://www.internautas.org/pagweb/3.html).\\n\\nThat same year, 1998, Netscape created the Mozilla organization, which led to the creation of the [Mozilla Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation) in 2003.\\n\\nAnd in 2000, the **[Spanish chapter of the Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/es/chapters/)** was founded.\\n\\n:::note\\nDid you know that at the beginning of the Internet, it was the Internet providers themselves who usually provided us with our email accounts? Before Microsoft launched Hotmail in 1996 (now known as Outlook), or Yahoo! created Yahoo Mail in 1998, or Google inaugurated Gmail in 2004, which by the way, you could only access by invitation.\\n:::\\n\\n## Hosting and Search Engines\\n\\nWhen the Internet was arriving in Spain, the first web hosting providers, like [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) (1994), or later [Galeon.com](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispavista) (1999), began offering free web hosting as well.\\n\\n**This greatly reduced the barrier to entry for communities that wanted to collaborate by creating and sharing tutorials, news, etc.** Especially for those of us who were teenagers and couldn\'t afford a paid one.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that the first [search engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine) did not appear until the mid-90s (e.g. [Lycos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycos) \u201894, [Yahoo! Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search) \u201895, [AltaVista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista) \u201895, [Ol\xe9](https://www.xataka.com/historia-tecnologica/que-fue-ole-primer-gran-buscador-espanol-historia-fugaz-marcada-crecimiento-brutal-polemica) \u201896, [Hispavista](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispavista) \u201896, [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search) \u201897\u2026). Therefore, there were not only far fewer manuals and tutorials, but until then, it had been very difficult to find them.\\n\\n:::note\\n1995 is also the year when [Amazon launched one of the first online stores](https://www.versionmuseum.com/history-of/amazon-website). Here is [a video of Amazon on Kiro 7 News in 1997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmTNWynx7VQ).\\n:::\\n\\nAs a result of some of these collaborations, older people will remember the famous [Rinc\xf3n del Vago](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinc%C3%B3n_del_Vago) (~1998), a website mainly used by students to share academic papers and notes. But to give an example of a technical community, I will leave one that I was lucky enough to be a part of, [HackHispano](https://foro.hackhispano.com/threads/46039-HACKHISPANO-cumple-20-a%C3%B1os) (~1999).\\n\\n## IRC and Other Chats\\nIt was also when the [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) protocol became popular, and programs like [mIRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC) (1995) allowed us to connect to [public servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC#Timeline) like [IRC-Hispano](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC-Hispano), [freenode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode), [undernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undernet), etc. **For the first time in history**, it allowed **real-time chatting** with people from other parts of the world, I repeat, at the cost of a local call, something totally disruptive.\\n\\n:::note\\nFor the new generations; IRC is similar to Slack, Discord, etc. But where public servers gathered tens or hundreds of thousands of people, where anyone could create a \\"Room,\\" and whoever arrived first automatically became an *IRC operator* with moderation permissions. By the way, [there are still communities that continue to use IRC](https://x.com/hhkaos/status/1803719231659294820) as a communication tool \ud83d\ude09.\\n:::\\n\\nThere were many channels about #linux, #programming, #networks, ... but also #humor, #madrid, #manga, etc. However, it is true that many historic hacker communities like [!Hispahack](https://www.microsiervos.com/archivo/hackers/hispahack.html)/#hispahack (~1996) also started to gather here. In this [interview with Antonio Fernandes](https://youtu.be/uhcTvvpy1T8?si=tbN6mYoCBxohItNA&t=234) (in The Wild Project), you can hear about his beginnings in hacking at that time, and how he mentions other hacker communities/groups like [Ap\xf3stols](https://hackstory.net/Apostol.html) or [La Vieja Guardia](https://hackstory.net/La_Vieja_Guardia.html).\\n\\n:::info\\nThe movie [Hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)) released in 1995, explores the *hacker* and *cyberpunk* subcultures and shows [black hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker#Black_hat) hackers involved in a corporate extortion conspiracy.\\n:::\\n\\nIn 1996, the newsgroup [es.comp.os.linux](http://www.escomposlinux.org/) was born, dedicated to discussing the Linux operating system in Spain, and according to [hackstory.net](https://hackstory.net/Es.comp.os.linux.html), one of the main initiatives of Spanish Linux hackers.\\n\\n:::note\\nDuring this time, other messaging and VoIP tools like [ICQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ) (1996), [Terra chats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(company)) (1999), [MSN Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Messenger) (1999), [Skype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype) (2003) also became popular in Spain. Although I wouldn\'t say many community communications emerged around them.\\n:::\\n\\n## Conferences\\n\\nAt that time, the main technological conferences in Spain were:\\n* [SIMO TCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMO_TCI) (1994).\\n* [Computing Days of the Spanish Association of Computing and Automation](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (1995-1998).\\n* [Hispalinux Congress](https://web.archive.org/web/20010513202506/http://congreso.hispalinux.es/) (1998).\\n\\nIn the international scene, other popular conferences started:\\n* [Microsoft Professional Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Developers_Conference) (1992).\\n* [DEF CON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEF_CON) (1993).\\n* [Hackers on Planet Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_on_Planet_Earth) (1994).\\n* [Linux Kongress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Kongress) (1994).\\n* [JavaOne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaOne) (1996).\\n* [O\u2019Reilly Conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Media#Conferences) (1997).\\n* [LinuxWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinuxWorld_Conference_and_Expo) (1998) (renamed to OpenSource World in 2009)\\n* [FOSDEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM) (2001).\\n* etc.\\n\\n## Mailing Lists\\n\\nAlso at that time, **communities that gathered around mailing lists increased considerably**:\\n* Hispalinux.\\n* Lists of Linux user groups.\\n* [RedIRIS distribution lists](https://www.rediris.es/list/).\\n* etc.\\n\\n:::note\\nAt that time, there were already [mailing lists software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailing_list#See_also) like [LISTSERV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISTSERV). In 1992, [Majordomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majordomo_(software)) was created as freeware, and later [GNU Mailman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Mailman) (1999). It wasn\'t until 2001 that [Google Groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Groups) was launched, another system that gave a strong boost to mailing lists among communities.\\n:::\\n\\n## LAN Parties\\n\\nThis is the era of the first [LAN parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_party), groups of friends who gathered at someone\'s house to play network games and sometimes see things we shouldn\'t \ud83e\udd23.\\n\\nAlso, macro gatherings like the [Euskal Party](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euskal_Encounter) (1993) or [Campus Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_Party) (1996) began, where many of us took our desktop computers, got on a bus, and traveled across Spain to spend a few days surrounded by hundreds or thousands of technology enthusiasts playing games, burning CDs, etc.\\n\\n:::note\\nIn 1994, the first [CD burners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc_drive) arrived, causing an unprecedented increase in piracy in Spain. Years later, [Napster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster) (1999), eDonkey ([2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDonkey2000)), [eMule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMule) (2002), ... and other technologies that would further boost it emerged.\\n:::\\n\\nA few years later, in 1998, the **video game and multimedia developer community [Stratos](https://stratos-ad.com/nosotros)** emerged.\\n\\n:::note\\nIn 1999, the program [Roger Wilco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Wilco_(software)) appeared, software that revolutionized VoIP communications among the gaming community.\\n:::\\n\\n## Cybercaf\xe9s\\n\\nWith the arrival of [ISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDN), which significantly improved Internet connection speeds, the first [Internet caf\xe9s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_caf%C3%A9) ([~1995](https://www.businessinsider.es/historia-ciberteca-primer-cibercafe-toda-espana-647001)) began to emerge. These became other meeting points where groups of friends would gather to play, talk, and share things they had discovered on the Internet, etc., and where some \u201chackers\u201d \ud83d\ude1c took advantage of installing [keyloggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging) and [trojan horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing)) for somewhat illicit purposes.\\n\\n:::note\\nAround 1999, [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) (or 802.11 protocol) [became popular in Spain](https://www.telefonica.com/es/sala-comunicacion/noticias/el-wifi-cumple-22-anos-y-alberga-dos-tercios-del-trafico-de-internet-en-espana/), which was the year the [Wi-Fi Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance) registered the brand.\\n:::\\n\\n## Bloggers\\n\\nAt the end of the millennium, in 1999, blogs, formerly also called [weblogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog), began to gain popularity, perhaps triggered by the launch of [Blogger.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)).\\n\\nIn that same year, [Barrapunto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrapunto) (1999) was born, a news website related to free software, technology, and digital rights. In 2001, it began offering a weblog system called MiBarrapunto.\\n\\nA famous blog that started talking about free culture at that time was [Ignacio Escolar\'s](https://web.archive.org/web/20030212231211/http://escolar.net/) (~2001).\\n\\nThen [Blogalia](https://web.archive.org/web/20030409203240/http://www.blogalia.com/historias/3) (~2001/2002) was born, another weblog server in Spanish.\\n\\nWhat I would like to comment on here is the fact that **the comments on *some* blogs almost became community chats**.\\n\\n:::info\\nIn 2003, [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress) was created, and Blogger.com was acquired and relaunched by Google.\\n:::\\n\\n## End of the Era\\n\\nAccording to the [Scientific Computing Society of Spain](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/), it is estimated that by the end of the century, a total of about 68,705 people had graduated in computing in Spain (~2450 per year).\\n\\nIt is also when the first [Official Colleges of Computer Engineers](https://www.cpitia.org/el-colegio/ingenieria-tecnica-informatica/historia/#La_ingenieria_tecnica_informatica_como_profesion_sujeta_a_especial_control) (e.g. Murcia, Catalonia, Asturias, ...) (1998-2002) began to be formed, and when the [Association of Women Researchers and Technologists](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asociaci%C3%B3n_de_Mujeres_Investigadoras_y_Tecn%C3%B3logas) (2001) emerged.\\n\\n:::note\\nAt this time, [phone booths](https://www.movistar.es/blog/home/cabina-telefonica-historia-cabinas-espana/) were still being used, although Internet and GSM coverage was growing rapidly. Operators like Telef\xf3nica, Airtel, Amena, ... opened the telecommunications market in Spain, and Nokia launched the popular [Nokia 3310](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310). But despite everything, SMS and voice calls still dominated communications.\\n\\nIt is also when we experienced the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) burst (~2001). A year later, Amazon would start the cloud revolution by creating [AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services).\\n:::\\n\\n## International Scene\\n\\nNow let\'s review other events that happened internationally and later had an impact on technical communities in Spain.\\n\\n### Hackerspaces\\n\\nAround 1992, [hackerspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) began to emerge, physical spaces where people interested in new technologies, electronics, digital arts, etc. met, socialized, and collaborated.\\n\\nI wrote about [HackSpace / HackLab / MakerSpace / Fab Lab in this page](https://www.rauljimenez.info/es/docs/communities/types-of-technical-communities#hackspace--hacklab--makerspace--fab-lab).\\n\\n### Other Communities\\n\\nIn 1993, [the IBM community appears](https://youtu.be/vIW1GUcmN2s?si=RZ51utbBGo_xAbdm&t=776).\\n\\nThe same year the first version of [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) was released (1995), one of the first [Java Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/denverjavausersgroup/) (the Denver one) was formed.\\n\\nThen in 2001, many things happened:\\n\\n* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) was created, around which a vast community of contributors would emerge (including [local communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikimedia_chapters)).\\n* The [Python Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation) was born, which would foster the creation of [local user groups](https://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups), now boasting over 1600 groups and more than 800,000 members.\\n* And the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) occurred.\\n\\n:::note\\nAccording to Wikipedia, these attacks led to the creation of [Meetup.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meetup) in 2002, a platform that originally aimed to bring together people with common hobbies and interests, and which would later be widely used by technical communities.\\n:::\\n\\n### Recognitions\\n\\nI found that around 1993, [Microsoft was already recognizing some developers\' contributions](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brief-history-microsoft-mvp-program-hal-hostetler-3rggc/), which could be considered the precursor to the Microsoft MVP program, and what in the future would likely lead to other programs of \\"*champions*\\", \\"*ambassadors*\\", etc.\\n\\n:::note\\nThese programs recognizing developers\' contributions would be seen as highly useful by professionals to develop personal branding, a concept introduced by Tom Peters in 1997 and which would become popular in Spain a few years later.\\n:::\\n\\n### Open Culture\\n\\nTwelve years after the founding of the Free Software Foundation (in 1997), developer Bruce Perens created [The Open Source Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition), and a year later co-founded the [Open Source Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative), which popularized the term \\"*open source*\\" and advocated for open-source software from a pragmatic and business-friendly perspective.\\n\\n:::note\\nTo date, the most iconic example of a company based on free software is [Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat), although years later, around 2008, other (controversial) models like open-core would become popular.\\n:::\\n\\nEarly initiatives focused on [open-source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware), such as the \\"[Open Hardware Certification Program](https://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/1997/msg00026.html)\\" and the \\"[Open Hardware Specification Project](https://web.archive.org/web/19981212031618/http://www.openhardware.org/)\\" were also launched around that time.\\n\\nIn 1999, the [Apache Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation) was created to support various open-source software projects. And one of the first websites offering free hosting for the developer community to share open-source projects, [Sourceforge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge), was launched.\\n\\nIn 2000, the [Open Source Development Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Development_Labs) was founded to promote Linux in enterprise computing, which years later (in 2007) would become the [Linux Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Foundation).\\n\\nIt was also during this time (2001) that Lawrence Lessig, a lawyer and political activist, created [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons), an organization dedicated to facilitating access to educational content and increasing the amount of creative works available for others to legally build upon and share.\\n\\n:::info\\nIn 2001, the documentary \\"[Revolution OS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eluzi70O-P4)\\" was released, which tells the story of Linux, open source and the free software movement.\\n:::\\n\\n### Social Networks\\n\\nWe could say that the beginnings of social networks also occurred at the end of this era with the birth of:\\n\\n* [SixDegrees.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SixDegrees.com) (~1998)\\n* [Last.fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm) (2002)\\n* [Friendster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster) (2003)\\n* [MySpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace) (2003)\\n* [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn) (2003)\\n* [Hi5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi5) (2004)\\n* Etc.\\n\\nAlthough out of all these, I would say the only well-known ones in Spain were MySpace and perhaps Last.fm, mainly for communities around music.\\n\\n## Conclusions\\n\\nIn this era, we can undoubtedly say that **online communities exploded, mainly with text interactions, mailing lists, and blog comments**. Although voice calls (among gamers primarily) also began.\\n\\nProfessional associations and those around different technologies continued to be created, but now they were not necessarily local. Some new conferences emerged, but they were still not very common.\\n\\n**Some communities emerged around topics like** Internet, Linux, hacking, game programming, women in technology, digital journalism, hardware (e.g. overclocking, open hardware, ...), etc.\\n\\nBased on this information, I would say that at this time, a community was understood as: a group of people who gathered (online or in person), voluntarily and on their own initiative, sharing an interest in technology, to collaborate with each other.\\n\\nAnd you, what do you think?\\n\\nIf you liked it, I will soon publish the next article in the series: \u201c2004-2012: The emergence of modern conferences and tech meetups\u201d"},{"id":"first-associations-and-online-communities","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/first-associations-and-online-communities","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2024-07-06/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-06/index.md","title":"1\ufe0f\u20e3 [1975-1991] First associations and online communities","description":"\u26a0\ufe0f Notices and acknowledgments","date":"2024-07-06T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 6, 2024","tags":[{"label":"history","permalink":"/blog/tags/history"},{"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"label":"tech community","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-community"},{"label":"meetups","permalink":"/blog/tags/meetups"},{"label":"spain","permalink":"/blog/tags/spain"}],"readingTime":9.08,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Raul Jimenez Ortega","title":"Principal Product Engineer, DevRel @ Esri","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimenezortegaraul/","socials":{"x":"hhkaos","github":"hhkaos"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/hhkaos.png","key":"hhkaos"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"first-associations-and-online-communities","title":"1\ufe0f\u20e3 [1975-1991] First associations and online communities","authors":["hhkaos"],"tags":["history","community","tech community","meetups","spain"],"enableComments":true},"prevItem":{"title":"2\ufe0f\u20e3 [1992-2003] The rise of online communities","permalink":"/blog/the-rise-of-online-communities"},"nextItem":{"title":"\ud83d\udcd6 History of technology communities","permalink":"/blog/history-of-technical-communities"}},"content":"<details><summary>\u26a0\ufe0f <strong>Notices and acknowledgments</strong></summary>\\n<p>\\n\\nI would like to start by clarifying that:\\n* I was born in 1984, so what I put in this article is mostly the result of my research and contributions received.\\n* I am sure that this article has gaps and errors.\\n* I am grateful for all contributions, which of course will be appreciated and will be under [CC Attribution 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\\n\\n**Acknowledgments**: to [JJ Merelo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-j-merelo-0815/) for his contributions and to [SCIE](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) because their website has been enormously helpful.\\n    \\n</p>\\n</details>\\n\\nIn this first article of the series \\"[History of technical communities](../2024-07-05/index.md),\\" we will review the history of technical communities in Spain, before the Internet, during the era when computing arrived and the revolution of [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_personal_computers) began.\\n\\n## Previous context\\n\\nLet\'s review some facts from the national and international context to set the stage.\\n\\n### United States\\n\\n1975 is the year when the United States ended the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War).\\n\\n[IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM) was already 64 years old, the giant and world leader in manufacturing computers ([mainframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer)) used by companies, government institutions, and academia.\\n\\nAnother company, [Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation), which in 1998 would be acquired by Compaq, began marketing in 1960 what they called Programmed Data Processors (PDP) around which user groups would be created.\\n\\nAt that time [Xerox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox) held a dominant position in the photocopier market. It was one of its printers that in 1980 would give rise to the anecdote that would eventually lead Richard Stallman to the creation of the Free Software Foundation.\\n\\nUntil recently, software was not perceived as a product. It was when IBM decided to unbundle it from hardware (in 1969) that the independent software vendor industry ([ISVs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_software_vendor)) was born, where companies such as Microsoft would soon play a fundamental role.\\n\\nBy this time, some of the first [user groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Users%27_group) or communities I could find were already a few years old, such as:\\n\\n- [TMRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club), MIT students related to hacking culture (1946).\\n- [SHARE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing)), IBM mainframe user group (1955).\\n- [GUIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUIDE_International), an IBM systems user group (1956).\\n- [DECUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECUS), the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) computer user group (1961).\\n\\nIn 1963, the [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers) was created, a non-profit organization that would later create standards such as [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3) (1983), [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11) (1997), etc.\\n\\nBy then, some notable computing conferences that brought together technical profiles had already been held, such as the [International Solid-State Circuits Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Solid-State_Circuits_Conference) (1954) and the [Symposium on Operating Systems Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_on_Operating_Systems_Principles) (1967).\\n\\nOn the other hand, Intel, already 7 years old, launched the first microprocessor in 1971, the [Intel 4004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004) (at a cost of $450, as of 2023), which would revolutionize the personal computer industry.\\n\\n### Spain\\n\\nNow let\'s review some important facts related to computing in Spain before the dictator [Francisco Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco) died in 1975 after 36 years in power.\\n\\nUp to that date, the most notable figure in the sector I have found is [Jos\xe9 Garc\xeda Santesmases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Garc%C3%ADa_Santesmases), a physicist and pioneer of computing in Spain who was 68 years old that year. He:\\n\\n- Created the Institute of Electricity and Automation (1952).\\n- Organized an [international automation congress](https://web.archive.org/web/20140607041251/https://www.scie.es/historia-progreso-informatica-cientifica-universitaria-espana/congresos-informatica-cientifica-universitaria/) (1958).\\n- Created the Spanish Association of Computing and Automation (AEIA) (1967).\\n- Organized the [First National Congress of Automation](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (1970).\\n    \\nIt was also before Franco\'s death that the [Association of Computing Technicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Engineers_Association_of_Spain) (1967) and the [Institute of Computing](https://www.fi.upm.es/web/historia/institutodeinformatica/) under the Ministry of Education and Science (1969) were created.\\n\\nIn 1971, an order (law) was approved in Spain, and that would establish the study plans for [the different degrees](https://www.cpitia.org/el-colegio/ingenieria-tecnica-informatica/historia/), which shortly afterwards would give rise to the first Faculties of Computer Science.\\n\\n## The Spanish transition\\n\\nThe same year Franco died, in the United States, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) and launched what is considered the first personal computer that was well-received by the market (in terms of performance/price ratio), the [Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800).\\n\\nIn this year (1975), the mythical [Homebrew Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club) was also founded, where Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs showed their [Apple 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I) in 1976, a moment \u201cimmortalized\u201d in movies like [Pirates of Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley) ([see sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxthr3fq-EI)) or [Jobs (2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs_(film)).\\n\\nIn 1976, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne founded [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.), and launched the [Apple-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I). The same year Bill Gates wrote his famous letter \u201c[An Open Letter to Hobbyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists)\u201d.\\n\\n:::note\\nThe first film documenting the Apple-Microsoft rivalry, [Pirates of Silicon Valley](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley), was not released until 1999.\\n:::\\n\\n\\n\\nThat year was when the first Computer Sciences Faculties were created in Spain at the Polytechnic Universities of Madrid and Barcelona, and the University of Valladolid ([see more](https://www.cpitia.org/el-colegio/ingenieria-tecnica-informatica/historia/#:~:text=El%20Decreto%20593%2F1976%2C%20de,su%20centro%20de%20San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n.)).\\n\\n## First associations\\n\\nOn June 15, 1977, the first democratic elections were held in Spain.\\n\\nShortly after, the **[Constitution of Spain (1978)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Spain)** was approved, which among many other things **includes the right to [freedom of association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association)**, which would promote the formation of many associations in Spain from which articles, manuals, and case studies would be published.\\n\\nSome of these associations are:\\n\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Association of Graduates in Computing Engineering](https://www.ali.es/presentacion/) (1980).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Spanish Association for Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis](https://www.aerfai.org/) (1982).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aepia.org/historia_aepia/) (1983).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing](http://www.sepln.org/) (1984).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Ada Spain Association](http://www.adaspain.org/) (1987).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Association for the Development of Educational Computing](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (1989).\\n\\nIn parallel, outside Spain, other notable groups were formed:\\n- \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea [Chaos Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club), a hackers association (1981).\\n- \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 [Macintosh User Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_User_Group) (1984).\\n- \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 [Apple User Group Connection (AUGC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_User_Group_Connection) (1985), [promotional video from 1991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkvtERqJnp0).\\n\\n## First online communities\\nAlso, around this time (early 80s), the first online communities could be said to emerge, gathering around bulletin board systems ([BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system)), the precursors to today\'s forums.\\n\\nAlmost in parallel, [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) emerged (~1980), another system for exchanging opinions and experiences. This is the system [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#GNU_project) used in 1983 to announce his plan for the [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) operating system. Two years later, in 1985, he founded the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation), whose philosophy would have a significant impact on the world of software and soon after on hardware, and of course around many technical communities.\\n\\nShortly after Usenet, in the year when [Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext) was being experimented with in Spain and we could listen to Michael Jackson\'s recently released Thriller on the [walkmans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman) (1982), Telef\xf3nica began marketing [Minitel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel), a system that could be used to access the phone book, retail shopping, access company information services, databases, forums, and messaging.\\n\\nIn that same year (1982), [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) was founded, a company that would compete with DEC in the sale of servers and workstations, and where in 1991 they would start working on the project that would result in the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) language.\\n\\nIn 1984, [FidoNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet) emerged, a popular network of BBS nodes that would gain traction in Spain and for the first time allow many strangers to communicate worldwide via computers over telephone lines. For example, the node \\"2:345/801\\" was the address of a board called \u201c[Atlantis](https://groups.google.com/g/soc.culture.spain/c/jGLymQIac3I)\u201d whose operator was Alfredo Sanchez, from Granada, and whose phone number was \u201c958132748\u201d. More information in \\"[Traveling in time: SysOp of a BBS in 1997 and Fidonet in Spain](https://carrero.es/sysop-de-una-bbs-fidonet-1997/)\\". Here is another list of [nodes from 1987](http://www.textfiles.com/fidonet-on-the-internet/n1987/nodelist.289), and here are [other nodes from Spain](https://www.cyberiada.org/r34.htm).\\n\\n## Conferences\\n\\nIn the national scene, most of the technical conferences and events held were more from the university sector:\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Automation Days](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comit%C3%A9_Espa%C3%B1ol_de_Autom%C3%A1tica) of the Spanish Automation Committee (1977).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [IV National Congress of Computing and Automation](https://www.ceautomatica.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/50-ANIVERSARIO-DEL-CEA_1967-2017.pdf) (AEIA) (1979).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [V Congress of Computing and Automation](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (AEIA) (1982).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Congress of the Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aepia.org/caepia/) (1985).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [VI Congress of Computing and Automation](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (AEIA) (1985).\\n\\nAnd in the United States, here are some that seemed interesting to highlight:\\n- \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 [History of Programming Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Programming_Languages_(conference)) (1978)\\n- \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 [IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Symposium_on_Security_and_Privacy) (1980)\\n- \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 [Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference) (WWDC) (1983)\\n\\n## PCs and video games\\n\\nThroughout this decade (the 80s), [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386) (1985) and [486](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I486) (1989) computers arrived in many Spanish homes, and video game consoles began to flood houses: [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) (1982), [Nintendo NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) (1983), [Sega SG-1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG-1000) (1983) [Amstrad CPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) (1984), [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) (1985), [Atari 7800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_7800) (1986), [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) (1989), ... In this climate, the first meeting called the [Game Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Developers_Conference) was organized in 1988, in California, with about 20 people that would grow to about 125 the following year, and today gathers nearly 28,000 people.\\n\\nAs can be read in the [History of personal computers in Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_personal_computers), by this time [Texas Instruments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Instruments) was the largest chip manufacturer in the world, and one of the high-tech electronics companies that entered the home computer market in 1979.\\n\\nThe [Compaq Computer Corporation](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compaq) founders worked there, until ~1978, when they founded Compaq and launched their first product, a portable personal computer (*portable* computer) inspired by [Osborne 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_1) but compatible with IBM software, mainly oriented to professionals. If you want to know more, the documentary \\"[Silicon Cowboys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TlIS1J7qCY)\\" tells the story of Compaq and its impact on the development of portable computers. You can watch [the launch event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7THrlGIL9k0) here.\\n\\n\\n## End of the era\\n\\nOther relevant events at the end of this era:\\n\\n- [RedIRIS](https://www.rediris.es/rediris/historia/index.html.es) (1988) emerged in Spain, the Interconnection Network of Computing Resources for universities and research centers.\\n- [Guy Kawasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki) created a team of evangelists at Apple.\\n- The popular [Concurrent Versions System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) (CVS) was born (1990).\\n- Also in 1990, Open Design Circuits proposed the creation of a hardware design community with the spirit of free software ([more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware)).\\n- Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger introduced the concept of \u201c[Community of Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice)\u201d that accompanies us to this day and is defined as: \u201ca group of people who share an interest, deepen their knowledge and experience in the area through continuous interaction that strengthens their relationships\u201d (1991).\\n\\nFinally, what would change society and the community ecosystem in the coming years was presented by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) in 1991, the foundations of the World Wide Web.\\n\\n## Conclusions\\n\\nAs we have observed, during this era, computing arrived in Spain, along with the constitution and the first associations, which emerged around the scientific and university community.\\n\\n- The first computing, automation, and artificial intelligence conferences were held. At the same time, BBS and Usenet emerged, where the first more informal online communities began to form.\\n- Internationally, the first user groups and computer hobbyist clubs emerged around electronics, specific company systems, hacking... along with some conferences that were mainly face-to-face.\\n\\n**In summary, these groups and conferences talked about**: operating systems, automation, robotics, circuits, programming languages, artificial intelligence, IBM systems, Apple, video games, networks, and security.\\n\\nBased on this information, I would say that when we talked about community in Spain at this time, we mainly referred to: a group of people who meet in person on their own initiative and share an interest in software, whose goal is professional development. Mainly to publish articles, manuals, and case studies.\\n\\nAnd you, what do you think?\\n\\nIf you liked it, you can continue reading in the following article of the saga: \\"[1992-2003: The rise of online communities](../2024-07-07/index.md)\\"."},{"id":"history-of-technical-communities","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/history-of-technical-communities","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2024-07-05/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-05/index.md","title":"\ud83d\udcd6 History of technology communities","description":"Following a series of reflections that led me to consider what a technical community is (for me), I decided to start this series of articles that compile the most relevant facts from the world of technology and communities, with a special focus on Spain.","date":"2024-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 5, 2024","tags":[{"label":"history","permalink":"/blog/tags/history"},{"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"label":"tech community","permalink":"/blog/tags/tech-community"},{"label":"meetups","permalink":"/blog/tags/meetups"}],"readingTime":1,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Raul Jimenez Ortega","title":"Principal Product Engineer, DevRel @ Esri","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimenezortegaraul/","socials":{"x":"hhkaos","github":"hhkaos"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/hhkaos.png","key":"hhkaos"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"history-of-technical-communities","title":"\ud83d\udcd6 History of technology communities","authors":["hhkaos"],"tags":["history","community","tech community","meetups"],"enableComments":true},"prevItem":{"title":"1\ufe0f\u20e3 [1975-1991] First associations and online communities","permalink":"/blog/first-associations-and-online-communities"},"nextItem":{"title":"\ud83d\udc65 What is a technical community?","permalink":"/blog/what-is-a-technical-community"}},"content":"Following a series of reflections that led me to consider [what a technical community is (for me)](../2024-07-04/index.md), I decided to start this series of articles that compile the most relevant facts from the world of technology and communities, with a special focus on Spain.\\n\\nThe goal is to document the history and help us reflect on the past, **understand how and why technological communities have evolved the way they have**, and establish a common framework to help dispel some of the current controversies.

It is mainly aimed at people with experience or the intention to create technical communities, with the purpose of **helping to create healthier, more attractive, useful, and sustainable communities**.\\n\\nIn this context, I find myself needing to define what a technical community is, at least for me.\\n\\n## An ambiguous term\\n\\nTo begin with, I hope everyone agrees with me that the term *[community](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/community)* not only has many meanings and synonyms, but it has been used to refer to many things, sometimes more accurately and sometimes less so, making it very ambiguous.\\n\\nFor example, when we talk about a community, we could be referring to a multitude of things (at least in Spanish):\\n\\n- A [collective](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/collective) \\n- A [guild](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/gremio)\\n- A [group](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/group?m=form) (e.g., [mutual aid group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid), group of users/customers, ...)\\n- A [club](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/club?m=form) (e.g., [book discussion club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_discussion_club), [fan club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_club)\\n- A [tribe](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tribu?m=form)\\n- A [gang](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pandilla?m=form)\\n- A [sect](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/secta?m=form), [clan](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/clan?m=form), or [The Fellowship of the Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring) \ud83d\udc8d\ud83d\ude02\\n- ...\\n\\nIn the tech world, the term has been used, and we could even say... abused or misused to the point where some of us feel that the romantic meaning of the word has been distorted.\\n\\nHere are some illustrative examples in different contexts:\\n\\n- **The community of a technology** <br/>(e.g., [Python community](https://www.python.org/community/), [Java community](https://dev.java/community/), [Android community](https://developer.android.com/community), \u2026)\\n- **The community of a platform** <br/> (e.g., [GitHub community](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines), [Twitch community](https://meetups.twitch.tv/), [Reddit community](https://investor.redditinc.com/overview/default.aspx), Stack Overflow, Meetup\u2026)\\n- **The external community of a brand or organization** <br/> (e.g., [GDG community](https://developers.google.com/community-guidelines), [GDE](https://developers.google.com/community/experts), [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/community), [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines), [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/communities), [CodelyTV](https://codely.com/)...)\\n- **The internal community (of employees) of a brand or organization** <br/> (e.g., [SNGULAR](https://x.com/jlvallejo/status/1785255285709312510), [Izertis Community](https://www.youtube.com/@Izertis.Community), [Adevinta](https://x.com/AdevintaEng?t=eg4u-3nKizm-2XK_0-if4Q&s=08), ...)\\n- **The community of an influencer** <br/> (e.g., [Midudev](https://discord.com/servers/midudev-aprende-y-mejora-en-programacion-741237973663612969), [mouredev](https://github.com/mouredev/Monthly-App-Challenge-2022), ...)\\n- **The community of a movement, practice, or methodology** <br/> (e.g., [Open source community](https://github.com/open-source), [Agile community](https://www.agilealliance.org/communities/), ...)\\n- **The community of an event/conference** <br/> (e.g., [Codemotion](https://community-es.codemotion.it/comunidad), ...)\\n- **The community of a field or guild** <br/> (e.g., Frontend, Backend, DevOps, ...)\\n- ...\\n\\nThis often leads to debates about what we generally mean by community in the tech world.\\n\\nKeep in mind that language evolves over time, and the use of words is closely linked to the context in which they are expressed. To dig a bit more into this, I\u2019ve decided to start a series of articles on the [History of technical communities (in Spain)](../2024-07-05/index.md).\\n\\n## My definition\\n\\nHere\u2019s what I understand by technical community, in the most traditional/romantic sense, heavily influenced by [my own life experience](https://www.rauljimenez.info/es/docs/about-me/open-culture#communities), and clearly biased:\\n\\nIt is a **group of people** who:\\n\\n- Emerge from **their own initiative** ([grassroots movement](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimiento_de_bases)).\\n- **Share an interest in technology** (software or hardware), for example: programming languages, methodologies, cybersecurity, data, or robotics.\\n- **Are governed by a set of norms** or rules, whether implicit or explicit (like a code of conduct, decalogue, nettiquete, ...) and **defined by the community itself**.\\n- Have a **purpose** or goal more focused on **professional or personal development** rather than pure entertainment.\\n\\nWhere all these people, both promoters and other participants, voluntarily decide to invest part of their **free time** (out of intrinsic motivation), and sometimes money, to interact regularly with each other. Sometimes without expecting anything more than the satisfaction of helping others, sharing knowledge, sharing experiences, learning from others, collaborating on projects, and ultimately **enjoying with like-minded people their passion for technology in their free time**.\\n\\nAlways **altruistically**, and even seeking the good of others at their own expense, often leading to the **formation of strong bonds**.\\n\\nIf I had to name some communities that I think would fit quite well, they would be:\\n- [!Hispahack](https://www.microsiervos.com/archivo/hackers/hispahack.html)\\n- [Hispalinux](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispalinux)\\n- [Local Python communities](https://es.python.org/comunidades/)\\n- [HOT communities](https://www.hotosm.org/community/)\\n- etc.\\n\\nThat said, I must say that:\\n- This definition probably does not apply to more than 90% of the communities that exist today.\\n- Nor does it mean I do not appreciate or admire other types of communities.\\n\\n## The controversy\\n\\nThe other day, thinking about some classic debates where people from the same generation discussed whether \u201cX\u201d was a community or not, I remembered when my father used to tell me: \u201c*what you\u2019re listening to isn\u2019t music, it\u2019s noise!*\u201d Does that sound familiar? Personally, I think it\u2019s natural that as we get older, we hang on to our memories and nostalgia for something, and it\u2019s hard for us to accept that things change and evolve into something that we may or may not like.\\n\\nAnd more often than I\u2019d like, I find myself in similar debates: is an online community a real community? Is the community of a company a community? Is the community of X a community?, ...\\n\\n## What really matters\\n\\nBut I wonder, how important is the label we put on it?\\n\\nMy opinion is quite firm on this. I say that, as always, the most important thing is to seek what unites us and not what separates us. We are already in a sufficiently divided, confrontational, and polarized society, to add more fuel to the fire over things that, in my opinion... are [trivialities](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trivialities).\\n\\nJust like people, communities are diverse; you may like them more or less, and everyone will judge which people and communities they like better, seem healthier, or toxic, but in any case, what I say is... let\u2019s try to empathize, always act with respect, sincerity, honesty, and as far as possible... collaborate.\\n\\nIn my opinion, this is the antidote to most problems.\\n\\nAnd you, what do you think?"},{"id":"learn-to-teach-your-kids","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/learn-to-teach-your-kids","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2024-06-01/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-01/index.md","title":"\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Learn to teach (your kids)","description":"It\'s been a long time since I wrote about these topics...","date":"2024-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 1, 2024","tags":[{"label":"guide","permalink":"/blog/tags/guide"},{"label":"handbook","permalink":"/blog/tags/handbook"},{"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"label":"user groups","permalink":"/blog/tags/user-groups"},{"label":"meetups","permalink":"/blog/tags/meetups"}],"readingTime":8.91,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Raul Jimenez Ortega","title":"Principal Product Engineer, DevRel @ Esri","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimenezortegaraul/","socials":{"x":"hhkaos","github":"hhkaos"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/hhkaos.png","key":"hhkaos"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"learn-to-teach-your-kids","title":"\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Learn to teach (your kids)","authors":["hhkaos"],"tags":["guide","handbook","community","user groups","meetups"],"image":"/img/blogs/aprendiendo-a-aprender/learn-to-teach-your-kids.png","enableComments":true},"prevItem":{"title":"\ud83d\udc65 What is a technical community?","permalink":"/blog/what-is-a-technical-community"},"nextItem":{"title":"\ud83d\udce6 Resources for technical communities","permalink":"/blog/resources-for-community-leaders"}},"content":"<details><summary>It\'s been a long time since I wrote about these topics...</summary>\\n<p>\\n\\nSpecifically since I launched the [family blog attempt](https://familiajimenezcano.wordpress.com/) (in 2018), although I hope to find time another day to share these experiences. \\n\\nThe truth is that I would like to share how I am trying to get involved in my son\'s school.

For example:\\n  * In January, one with a beautiful cover\\n  * In February, one with illustrations\\n  * In March, another with a number in the title\\n  * In April, one turned into a movie\\n  * In May, one with an author from your country\\n  * In June, a graphic novel/comic.\\n\\nAlthough most books are recommended for children his age, in some ways it surprises me:\\n  * The length of the books, especially for **the pace at which they have to read**. Although I suppose it is good because **it requires them to read almost daily a chapter**, which will help them develop a reading habit.\\n  * **The vocabulary contained in the books**, sometimes quite advanced, which is good, I suppose.\\n\\n:::note\\nHere\'s a talk (in Spanish) that my good friend Jorge Barrachina recommended to me recently, Gregorio Luri\'s talk \\"[El arte de leer y el gusto por la lectura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UtwJHkhJ0s)\\".\\n:::\\n\\nBut I would like to know if I am the only one or if other families also have similar feelings. I encourage you to tell me in the [comments](#comments) \ud83d\ude1c.\\n\\n\x3c!-- \\n:::note\\n\\n::: --\x3e\\n\\n## The frustration\\n\\nIt all starts when after several weeks, after reading my son\'s summaries looking for spelling mistakes, **I realize that I don\'t understand the summaries very well**. So, with the idea of helping him improve them, I start asking him questions, to see if I can understand the plot better, but still **I\'m missing characters, or clarifications, or anything else** that makes it hard for me to understand the story.\\n\\nIn the end, both his mother and I decided that the best thing would be for **one of us to also read the book**, so we could help him because otherwise, how would we know if he had missed something important or not?\\n\\nWell... something that initially didn\'t seem complicated, I realized was more difficult than I thought \ud83d\ude05.\\n\\nOne of the things I have noticed while reading the books is that **every one or two pages, there are words that I suspect he doesn\'t know**, like *exhalation*, *arrogant*, *seep*, *utopian*, *electoral campaign*, ..., so every time I read one of his books, I ask him to verify. \\n\\nIndeed, many he doesn\'t know, and I always tell him:\\n\\n> *Jos\xe9, when you don\'t understand something...ask what it means! Because if you don\'t, you\'re probably not understanding the story well.*\\n\\nI always do it... even when I\'m reading [Mikecrack](https://www.amazon.es/Libros-Mikecrack/s?rh=n%3A599364031%2Cp_27%3AMikecrack) stories to him and his brother in bed before sleeping, but no matter how much I repeat it... there comes a time when he stops asking.\\n\\nBut well, once the entire book is read and all the vocabulary is reviewed, we move on to the summary. There, my method consists of reminding him that every story has:\\n* A **beginning**, where something usually happens that disrupts the order and:\\n  1. Creates a problem to solve.\\n  2. Is the trigger for an adventure.\\n* Then there\'s the **development** (or middle), which is what is told in most of the book.\\n* Then there\'s an **end** (or conclusion), where the situation is resolved, or the story ends, and everything returns to normal.\\n* And besides this, there are some **characters** more important than others, without whom the story could not be told well.\\n\\nAnd then I ask him to, using those four elements, tell me what happens at the beginning, the most important things that happen before reaching the end, how everything is resolved and returns to normal, and while doing that, explain who each of the characters are.\\n\\nWell, as you can imagine, despite all attempts and trying to give him hints, because to be honest, **even I sometimes find it hard to summarize**... I can\'t get the summary to meet my expectations \ud83d\ude05, which ends in my frustration \ud83d\ude21, for which I then have to apologize to him, explaining that it is not his fault but my own frustration for not being able to help him \ud83d\ude1e.\\n\\n## Asking for help from the teacher\\n\\nSo I said to myself, \\"*OK Ra\xfal, you\'re not doing it right, ask the teacher for help!*\\" (and that\'s what I did).\\n\\nAfter talking to her, she gave me some advice. Since the books are quite long, she told me to ask Jos\xe9 to **write down \\"the main ideas\\" of each chapter on a separate sheet**, and then with all of them, make the summary.\\n\\nHere are the notes we made from the book [Anna Kadabra 13.

So in the end, on more than one occasion, I end up telling him what I THINK is important and why.\\n\\n## Asking for help from my mother\\n\\nIn the end, I turned to my mother, because besides being my mother, she was my language teacher, and the teacher of many children in a school in Nerja.\\n\\nShe recommended a book that seemed promising: \\"[In primary school, learn to learn - 6: Learn to summarize and take notes](https://www.amazon.es/primaria-aprende-aprender-Educacion-Diversidad/dp/8477742847/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=2ZTNV4YYNDBSB&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.YvATtILgUCt4Sdi9g2stKg.l42L1kExAVdNFHsgPpk1jV1G5upoy6ID5Mw-EA_Hw1s&dib_tag=se&keywords=En+primaria+aprende+a+aprender+-+6%3A+Aprende+a+resumir+y+tomar+apuntes&qid=1717253519&s=books&sprefix=en+primaria+aprende+a+aprender+-+6+aprende+a+resumir+y+tomar+apuntes+%2Cstripbooks%2C110&sr=1-1)\\", and I, as an obedient son (sometimes \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c), bought it.\\n\\nAs you can see on Amazon, the book was published in 2001 (more than 20 years ago!), but what caught my attention was what I saw in the introduction:\\n\\n[![Learning to learn 6 - Learn to summarize and take notes](/img/blogs/aprendiendo-a-aprender/aprendiendo-a-aprender.png)](/img/blogs/aprendiendo-a-aprender/aprendiendo-a-aprender.png)\\n\\nSeeing that \\"in the past\\" it wasn\'t until the age of 10 that summaries were learned reassured me. This, along with the last meeting with my son\'s teacher, who again hinted that I shouldn\'t be so demanding with the summaries, **I\'ve decided to relax and see it from another perspective** \ud83e\uddd8\ud83d\udc86.\\n\\n## My conclusions\\n\\nI have to get used to the fact that the summary is not *that important* (for now). What is important is that my son:\\n* **Keeps enjoying reading**.\\n* **Continues developing his reading speed and comprehension**.\\n* **Learns vocabulary**.\\n* And above all, **doesn\'t start disliking reading** because after... there\'s going to be a time of \\"dad\'s anger\\" ;(.\\n\\nSo now what I\'ve asked him to do is that when he reads a book:\\n* Have a blank sheet of paper at hand.\\n* Write down all the words he doesn\'t know.\\n* And ask Alexa ([Echo Show](https://www.amazon.es/echo-show-5-3a-generacion/dp/B09B2S8WKD/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1OUHNQYCKE44R&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iltfLFjhhpdfcrA9zwPEASiiau-PIgl9VcVBJ0Oys_mCTQROVOODJpcW3qujKJ4uE1kn8QpTNL8Z-Ack1Tq9WU7C-LTEtxlvDoafnTJ_eg8HjePETtV-67qphoEQL1gvYpwxm_pR913C2qJrOLV7qzvzyiTtsKBCKr8OXVlmn6pXps9cPji2GZmCo1YhZnWudymyrsIxsywOMsAxpDflraEiQqz2Jfe357ryQ0o2Ttc.1wETnQEDVJoyYReccEOyXD41MFzajElaVfEmnAF04Wo&dib_tag=se&keywords=alexa+pantalla&qid=1717344456&s=books&sprefix=alexa+pantalla%2Cstripbooks%2C118&sr=1-1)) what they mean, and write them down. I was going to buy him a traditional dictionary... but honestly, I think this way will be faster and he will use it more.\\n\\nBecause from now on, when I read the book, I will see if he has done \\"his homework\\" and taken notes, because **now instead of putting so much emphasis on the summary, we will try to get him into the habit of looking up what he doesn\'t understand, so he can learn vocabulary and better understand what he reads**.\\n\\nHow do you see it? Any advice? \ud83d\ude42.\\n\\n##

\\n\\n> **(2)** Next week is [CommitConf 2024](https://2024.commit-conf.com/en/), where the OpenSpace on \\"**How to sustain technical communities**\\" that [Dani Rey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-rey-rey-9022702a/), [Oskar Calvo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oskarcalvo) and I have proposed will take place, which will be \\"the continuation\\" of last year\'s Open Space where some of the challenges facing technical communities were discussed.\\n\\n## Communities in recess?\\n\\nAre the communities in recess?, are the communities having more problems now than before?\\n\\nAfter talking to many people, and in different forums, such as the Open Space, my perception is that there is a general feeling about the **drop of activity in many of the technology communities** (both in Spain and abroad) **in the last few years**, especially since the pandemic.\\n\\nBy \\"drop of activity\\" I mean a mix of things, but mainly I mean a lower attendance to meetings (face-to-face and online), interactions in mailing lists/IMs, etc.\\n\\nAnd this situation, worries those of us who energize communities.\\n\\nOne of the concerns that I have heard recurrently is that the average age of the people who are part of these communities is growing, or said with other words, that **it is difficult to attract and engage the new generations**. \\n\\nPersonally, I am reluctant to believe that this is because the experience offered by the communities no longer provides as much value to the new generations as other new formats, channels or \\"forums\\". \\n\\nBut before we continue... what is a community?\\n\\n## What is a community?\\n\\nOr rather, **what do I mean by community, or technology community**?\\n\\nPerhaps it is good to start with this question, since for example, during the Open Space, in my opinion, there were times when the conversation revolved around different concepts of \\"community\\". \\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Vibrant meeting space, technologists gather with faces animated by enthusiasm.](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/user-group-meetup-tech-community.png)](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/user-group-meetup-tech-community.png)\\n\\n</figure>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nIn my case, I talk about what is known as \\"[communities of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice)\\", which in short are **groups of people**(user groups, associations, meetups...) that:\\n\\n* **organize regular meetings** (face-to-face and/or online).\\n* **share a passion / profession / concerns, ... for technology** (software, hardware, methodologies or best practices, ...).\\n* mainly, **seek to collaborate with each other, voluntarily and altruistically**.\\n* they **seek the common benefit** above the particular one (including the particular interest of the organizations that may support/sponsor them).\\n* are **always open to new people**.\\n* feel part of the group and identify with it.\\n\\nSo, I just wanted to clarify that:\\n1. All this is in my experience and is based primarily on the type of communities I just described. \\n2. I believe that most of the ideas and tips shared in [the documents](/docs/category/-tech-communities), can be applied to this type of communities, whether they are local (in small and in big cities), as much as online/virtual, regardless of the fact that each one has its peculiarities.\\n\\nHaving said all of the above, it does not detract from the fact that some of **the tips can also be applied to people who are in the business of disseminating online content, or people who organize large conferences**. \\n\\n## What has changed?\\n\\nWhy do those of us who have been energizing communities have this feeling/perception?\\n\\nTo give some context, I started to get involved with this particular type of communities at the university (in ~2009), and since then [I have participated, contributed, founded and co-organized quite a few communities](https://www.rauljimenez.info/docs/about-me/open-culture#communities), organizing hundreds of meetings (of all kinds).\\n\\nBased on this experience, I would say that the feeling that activity is declining is mainly due to the fact that **it is harder for us to provide value** as we did before.\\n\\nNow the offer is wider and the attention is diversifying with the increase of communities, channels/media (Discords, Slacks, social newtwords, ...), but also the rise of [influencers](https://twitter.com/i/lists/828546487369990144/members). \\n\\n![The image shows a cluttered room, a person hiding behind his hands, drowned between screens and cables.](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/information-saturation-noise-social-networks.png)\\n\\nPersonally I also think that digital contact is eating more ground to the physical, just see that **almost everything is done through apps**: order food, a cab, talk / chat, procedures with the administration, ... even flirting! \ud83d\ude05 and I have no doubt that this also has consequences. \\n\\nThat is why I believe that it is not that communities do not provide value, but that they simply **have to take into account this change of context and reinvent/modernize themselves**. Remember, as Albert Einstein said, \\"_The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results_.\\"\\n\\nI hope that sharing some of the **advice** I heard at the Open Space, and some of my own, will serve to **help refloat some communities and help new ones to emerge**.\\n\\n> A book I really like that talks about adapting to change is [Who Moved My Cheese?](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Spencer-Johnson/dp/0399144463/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=39BAFS7MV20R5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zoT19YfaR2b08zVkjZe2e0OGdTMvrcOsvxtxkGnEU8moy5ou07-LLppVg8nedZprast3hMhTFCJaue9jlJgmw6ZsGnYK7H_L4l-zmECV3z4vsCf3Kb_4qbqZocy25grVymjCcjGOP4h2gaGylJ11DaDG5sN6Kk6FN_eJhS3y2OgVl2kcp5Lpm4xt-0TcK40SOUV0_mJS9wcVA0Nv14Qo0yP1jiKp2qbjKGpntuuDnQY.9rIUivJpeFpsMntNHayamLjJElSNfNsjOGx_HRWO-qw&dib_tag=se&keywords=Who+took+my+cheese%3F&qid=1712813883&sprefix=who+took+my+cheese+%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1) \ud83e\uddc0\ud83d\udc01.\\n\\n## Anatomy of communities\\n\\nAnd before I finish, I wanted to share some ideas and resources to share my understanding of communities.\\n\\nThe most basic are the **degrees of involvement**. I used to explain them this way to my Esri colleagues several years ago (~2017):\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Anatomy of a community diagram](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/anatomy-of-a-community.jpg)](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/anatomy-of-a-community.jpg)\\n\\n<figcaption>Anatomy of a community.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nAfter that, [Jorge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgebarrachina/) taught me several theories:  \\n* The *[Orbit Model](https://orbit.love/model)*, which serves as a model to explain that to increase the feeling of belonging to a group, it is necessary to increase the number of interactions and positive impacts between people, and that bonds are forged.\\n* The [1% rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule), which I use to adjust expectations that no more than ~1% will help to energize, nor ~10% participate, although really **measuring this is often quite subjective, just like trying to measure a friendship** (because at the end of the day, that\'s what they are).\\n* [The Community Maturity Model](https://communityroundtable.com/what-we-do/research/community-maturity-model/), an interesting framework for classifying different types of communities.\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Community Maturity Model -

It is one of the largest [events for developers that is held annually in Spain](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1571289000886910977). It is well attended and draws strong participation from around 50 Spanish technical communities.\\n\\n![Photo of the venue\'s lobby during event registration](./commitconf23-checkin.jpg)\\n\\n## Why attend conferences like CommitConf?\\n\\nAt the conference, developers were brought together to **retrain, discover, and share new insight and knowledge about our profession**. For example, attendees shared information about:\\n\\n* New tools and languages.\\n* New capabilities for the tools and languages already used by the community.\\n* How companies solve different software development challenges.\\n* Best practices in accessibility, security, and design patterns.\\n* New trends.\\n\\nAdditionally, the conference provided a place to meet new people and reconnect with those already known. At events like this, it\u2019s not uncommon to run into people you know! In my case, I bumped into some of my former colleagues, and some developers who use **[ArcGIS to create Location-Aware apps or map applications](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/)**.\\n\\n![Selfies taken by Raul with other developers during the event.](./commitconf23-developers.jpg)\\n\\n## What made this conference special?\\n\\nThis event, like many others, gives us, developers, the opportunity to **present talks, workshops, and even [Open Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology)**.\\n\\nFor attendees, a unique factor that sets this event apart from others is the system used to create the event\u2018s agenda, **allowing the communities themselves to be involved in the selection process of talks**. This system is called [Koliseo](https://koliseo.com/) and is free for anyone to use.\\n\\n## Why submit a proposal?\\n\\nGoing to an event like CommitConf **is an opportunity to learn from and contribute to the developer community**. And, there are many different motivations for a person to send a proposal.\\n\\n* There are people who simply **enjoy sharing knowledge and experiences**. \\n* Other attendees want to **increase the visibility of their company** and to raise awareness of the cool work they do, **with the hope of attracting new talent**. \\n* Some attendees want to **create a personal brand**.\\n* While others want to **discuss and find solutions to a problem with their colleagues**.\\n\\nAnd if you are lucky enough to have a proposal accepted, as in my case, you can **attend the speakers\u2019 dinner** the day before the event, where you meet a lot of experts on different topics \ud83d\ude0d. \\n\\n## What did Esri bring to the conference?\\n\\nFrom the company I work for ([Esri](http://esri.com/)), they have always encouraged me to attend to conferences and to send proposals that I thought might be relevant to other developers.\\n\\nThis time, I presented a variety of proposals:\\n\\n* DataViz & Map Optimization\\n* Designing Beautiful and Intelligent Maps\\n* Using and Creating Collections in Postman Like a Pro\\n* **\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd12 OAuth, OpenID Connect and JWT for Dummies**\\n\\nI was lucky that the conference organizers accepted \u201cOAuth, OpenID Connect, and JWT for Dummies\u201d because it gave me the **opportunity to share what these auth standards are and how they work**. I showed practical examples based on some of the resources that we have created from [Esri\'s Developer Experience team](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VMTWv3XRwWL4zG7rB8SlHkE5XXbd5OW), like the **[Authentication workspace in Postman](https://www.postman.com/esridevs/workspace/authentication-in-arcgis/overview)**.\\n\\n![Photo of Raul\'s talk during his talk on oAuth showing Raul speaking and the audience of about 100 people.](./commitconf23-raul-jimenez-ortega.jpg)\\n\\nIn case you want, you can **[check the slides out here](https://bit.ly/oauth-commit)**. If you are interested in the topic and want me to repeat this talk online, just let me know in the comments!\\n\\n## What did I learn at the conference?\\n\\nBelow are some of the takeaways from the sessions that I attended:\\n\\n* **Local Communities Outside Big Cities (Open Space)**: This session was super interesting. I had the opportunity to share tips and ideas to overcome challenges in creating and maintaining developer communities with approximately thirty other people. Among them were representatives from different communities about Python, Software Crafting, Data, Machine Learning, generalists\u2019 communities, Free Software, GNU/Linux, DevOps, Drupal, and us representing the [GeoDevelopers community](https://meetup.com/es-ES/geo-developers).\\n\\n> **Note**: After the session, I decided to create a guide with what we learned and our own experience. If you are interested, save the article in favourites because we will add it **[here]** in a few weeks.\\n\\n\\n![Photo of the Open Space on communities showing about thirty attendees seated in a circle.](./commitcont23-openspace.jpg)\\n\\n* **Detecting Web Performance Issues with Chrome DevTools**: [@nucliweb](https://twitter.com/nucliweb) gave an overview of the Chrome DevTools and showed us how they keep adding new tools like [Recorder](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/recorder/) and [Coverage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/coverage/) to help evaluate your web performance and optimize it. Also, he showed us how the new AVIF image format improves WebP performance. More info at [web.dev](https://web.dev/).\\n\\n* **Don\u2019t Yell at Me, I Can\u2019t See You**: [@javierabadia](https://twitter.com/javierabadia) and [@jameshedaweng](https://twitter.com/jameshedaweng) explained to us how to divide the responsibilities between an Engineering Manager and a Product Manager to avoid failure when creating a product. In summary, a PM must be responsible for *what* features to add and *why*, and the EM in the *how* and the *who*. The *when* should be a shared responsibility.\\n\\n* **Why I Decided to Pursue the Developer Relations Path**: [@kinisoftware](https://twitter.com/kinisoftware) told us about his experience as a Staff Developer Relations Engineer, where he works to promote the expertise of Criteo\u2019s technical team by facilitating participation in events and communities.\\n\\n* **Testing Web Accessibility**: [@bolonio](https://twitter.com/bolonio) showed us a multitude of tools and resources for testing web accessibility: [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y), [jest-axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe), [axe-core/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/cli), [pa11y](https://pa11y.org/), [pa11y-ci](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci), [axe chrome extension](http://deque.com/axe), [arc toolkit](http://paciellogroup.com/toolkit), [accessibilityinsights.io](http://accessibilityinsights.io/), [wave.webaim.org](https://wave.webaim.org/), and more.\\n\\n* **The Mistake of Becoming a Manager**: [@npatarino](https://twitter.com/npatarino) explained to us that becoming a manager of people is not the only way to have leadership or increase your salary. He said that for those senior software engineers who want to continue growing, there are other positions such as Staff Software Engineer, Principal Software Engineer, Distinguished Software Engineer and Technical Fellow.\\n\\n* **Past, Present and Future of EducaMadrid**: [@asanzdiego](https://twitter.com/asanzdiego) talked to us about the educational platform of the Community of Madrid that he leads; he told us about the technical challenges they suffered during the pandemic, when the number of active users grew exponentially, along with the strengths and limitations of his team and his technological stack based on free software.\\n\\n\\n![Composition of photographs of different sessions attended by Raul.](./commitconf23-techsessions.jpg)\\n\\nIn summary, if you don\'t use to go to developer conferences, **I hope my experience has encouraged you and given you arguments to attend in the future**. I would say also to the **[Esri Developer Summit in the USA](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit/)** (or [in Europe](https://www.esri.com/en-us/about/events/devsummit-europe/save-date)), although this rather applies if you are an Esri partner or customer \ud83d\ude09.\\n\\nRemember, **although much of the content of these conferences is then made available online, there are many other things that can only be achieved by attending.**\\n\\n> If you want to leave comments, you can do it in [the article published in Dev.to](https://dev.to/hhkaos/why-attend-developer-conferences-59b3)"},{"id":"about-geo-development-skills","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/about-geo-development-skills","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2023-04-28/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-28/index.md","title":"\ud83c\udf0e Geo skills for developers","description":"I have shared a new document (not 100% polished) where I try to explain what problems anyone can better solve by learning new geospatial skills and tools, including spatial databases, spatial analysis techniques, web mapping frameworks, geospatial libraries and APIs, spatial data formats, and spatial data visualization tools, GIS software, etc.","date":"2023-04-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 28, 2023","tags":[{"label":"learning","permalink":"/blog/tags/learning"},{"label":"career-path","permalink":"/blog/tags/career-path"},{"label":"geo","permalink":"/blog/tags/geo"}],"readingTime":1.035,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Raul Jimenez Ortega","title":"Principal Product Engineer, DevRel @ Esri","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jimenezortegaraul/","socials":{"x":"hhkaos","github":"hhkaos"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/hhkaos.png","key":"hhkaos"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"about-geo-development-skills","title":"\ud83c\udf0e Geo skills for developers","authors":["hhkaos"],"tags":["learning","career-path","geo"],"enableComments":true},"prevItem":{"title":"\ud83d\udc65 Why Attend Developer Conferences","permalink":"/blog/why-attend-developer-conferences"},"nextItem":{"title":"\ud83c\udd95 Welcome to the new website","permalink":"/blog/new-website"}},"content":"I have shared a new document (not 100% polished) where **I try to explain what problems anyone can better solve by learning new geospatial skills and tools**, including spatial databases, spatial analysis techniques, web mapping frameworks, geospatial libraries and APIs, spatial data formats, and spatial data visualization tools, GIS software, etc.\\n\\nI group them into five big categories:\\n\\n* [Geospatial algorithms.](/docs/geospatial/geo-developer-superpowers#geospatial-algorithms)\\n  * How to do spatial queries or operations.\\n  * How to do spatial calculations.\\n  * How to do network and topological analysis.\\n  * Geostatistical analysis.\\n  * Data transformations.\\n  * Georeferenced Image analysis (aerial, ground, satellite, ...).\\n* [Client-side development ](/docs/geospatial/geo-developer-superpowers#client-side-development)\\n  * Display 2D and 3D georeferenced data.\\n  * Create faster maps.\\n  * Customize / advance maps.\\n  * Interact with geospatial data.\\n  * Work with offline geospatial data.\\n  * Other.\\n* [Server-side development](/docs/geospatial/geo-developer-superpowers#server-side-development)\\n  * Design system architecture (how to store and access/integrate geospatial data).\\n  * Data capture/creation.\\n  * How to render 3D web animation as a video GPX track.\\n* [Data gathering and geolocation](/docs/geospatial/geo-developer-superpowers#data-gathering-and-geolocation)\\n\\t* Data gathering.\\n\\t* Data geolocation (georeferencing).\\n* [Map creation (not programmatically)](/docs/geospatial/geo-developer-superpowers#map-creation-not-programmatically).\\n\\nDo you want to help me increase the list?

Why? In my opinion, because:\\n\\n1.  **It forces me to be more structured**, for example:\\n    -   When it comes to work, I try to document all procedures.\\n    -   Procedures or work that I later share; for example, in articles on this blog like: [Partner Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2014/04/06/pacto-de-socios/), [Template for Creating an Analytics Plan](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2014/01/06/plantilla-para-crear-un-plan-de-analitica/), etc.\\n    -   I tend to use many task management tools that I later reuse in my work.\\n2.  Also, **I make myself write more** about what I have done so I don\'t forget it\\n    1.  For example, my [life summary posts](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/category/sobre-mi/) which also serve to keep my friends updated on how I am.\\n    2.  And to share [articles like this one](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2013/12/08/el-trabajo-perfecto/), which are thoughts I want to internalize (and writing helps).\\n3.  And finally, it also **helps you forget problems sooner or lessen the importance** of many of them.\\n\\nIn short, if someone ever criticizes you for having a bad memory, maybe you can counter-argue that... having a bad memory also has its advantages, what do you think?\\n\\nBy the way, this reasoning also applies to \\"**having scattered attention**,\\" anyone dare to justify the good in this? ^_^"},{"id":"mi-nuevo-trabajo-en-esri","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mi-nuevo-trabajo-en-esri","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2014-04-17/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-04-17/index.md","title":"\ud83d\udcbc My new job at Esri","description":"As I mentioned in a previous article, I have joined the Esri Spain team as a Developer Program Manager... and what does that entail?

Well, let me give you several examples:\\n\\n- Identifying the [best areas to live within a city](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://uji.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Filter/index.html?appid=96848387cd1a4ffeaf0bbc1a98699640) (based on certain criteria)\\n- Solving problems like: [what is the best location for my next business?](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.forbes.com/sites/barbarathau/2014/04/24/how-big-data-helps-retailers-like-starbucks-pick-store-locations-an-unsung-key-to-retail-success/)\\n- Creating [location-aware mobile applications](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.fastcolabs.com/3028819/the-big-question-in-retail-now-is-what-are-you-doing-with-geotriggers) that incorporate behaviors associated with their location.\\n- Setting up [dynamic and interactive 3D scenarios](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.arcgis.com/apps/CEWebViewer/viewer.html?3dWebScene=9c0e319bfaff4d33a0fe2da97c2c3fd7) (similar to Second Life)\\n- Representing and communicating large amounts of information in a more understandable ([map of England](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://illustreets.co.uk/explore-england)) or attractive way ([map with incredible places](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/?appid=35926d0e1c7741b59948ca45f4f33b3a)).\\n- [Conducting simulations](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://mappingpoint.blogspot.com.es/2014/01/terremotos-en-la-isla-del-hierro.html), analyzing geolocated data ([e.g., purchases](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://grupoweb.upf.es:8080/quartz/)) and predicting future situations ([queues in stores, etc](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/https://www.centrodeinnovacionbbva.com/en/pages/29293-winners)).\\n- [Other examples](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.geoases.com/inspiracion/)\\n\\nSo, it can be used to solve problems, optimize processes, communicate better, etc., and therefore, the applications are numerous and can be useful for individuals, companies, and governments.\\n\\nIf you are a programmer and are interested in learning more about this field, I invite you to **[join the Geo Developers Meetup](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.meetup.com/Geo-Developers/)** that I created to organize talks, workshops, etc., and help each other by sharing knowledge.\\n\\nSee you soon! ![:D](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438im_/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif)"},{"id":"invertir-en-formacion-online","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/invertir-en-formacion-online","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2014-01-04/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-01-04/index.md","title":"\ud83d\udcb0 Investing in online training","description":"Many people still hesitate to take the step of paying a fee to subscribe to a good online training service; and today I wanted to advocate for it because I believe it is more cost-effective compared to other formal training alternatives.

Here are a few other platforms with MOOCs that follow this line where you can find free courses (with paid certifications): [Coursera](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://coursera.org/), [Miriadax](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://miriadax.net/), [CodeAcademy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://www.codecademy.com/), and [EDX](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.edx.org/) (_thanks Pino for this last one!_).\\n\\nWell, in my case I pay a **$25 per month** subscription on Codeschool, which over these months (including discounts) has amounted to about \u20ac125, and although this may seem like a considerable amount, I think if we analyze what I\'ve gained in return it offers a different perspective.\\n\\nFor example, during this time I have [completed 9](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/users/227734) of the 36 courses they have available:\\n\\n\u2013 [Javascript Road Trip Part 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1) **(Free)**  \\n\u2013 [Javascript Road Trip Part 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-2)  \\n\u2013 [Javascript Road Trip Part 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-3)  \\n\u2013 [Coffeescript](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/coffeescript)  \\n\u2013 [Real-Time-Web with Node.js](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-nodejs)  \\n\u2013 [Discover DevTools](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/discover-devtools) **(Free)**  \\n\u2013 [Fundamentals of Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/fundamentals-of-design)  \\n\u2013 [Try Git](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) **(Free)**  \\n\u2013 [Try Ruby](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ruby)\\n\\nDoing the math, each paid course has cost me about \u20ac20 and I have invested ... I would say between 4 and 8 hours in each. If we do the math, I think it comes at a very reasonable price since the courses are of tremendous quality and include a lot of practical exercises that I believe **are making me a better professional**.\\n\\nWhat do you think about this, in **comparison to other training options**: workshops, training sessions, master\'s programs, etc. **Don\'t you think it\'s a good price?**"}]}')}}]);
