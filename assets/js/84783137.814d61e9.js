You should consider it in different scenarios. It is useful for large projects where several applications need to be built to consume geospatial information, using the implemented standards (data formats, style/symbology, ...) avoids to reinvent the wheel and can save a lot of implementation time (by using geospatial client libraries), but it also saves time with third party integrations, helps with performance to serve the large data (transform vector to raster server side, tiling, cache ...) support to manage geospatial files without a DBMS, etc.")),(0,i.yg)("h2",{id:"data-gathering-and-geolocation"},"Data gathering and geolocation"),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Geospatial data can be found in many places, so it is important to be familiar with the sources available, but more importantly, because some can be offered by different providers in different forms (with their respective advantages and limitations) ",(0,i.yg)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"to be able to find the best data possible it is important to have additional knowledge"),"."),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"Get more categories ",(0,i.yg)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://datos.gob.es/es"},"http://datos.gob.es/es")),(0,i.yg)("p",null,"What resolution do I need to build my app/analysis?
