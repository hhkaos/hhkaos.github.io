\\n\\n> **(2)** Next week is [CommitConf 2024](https://2024.commit-conf.com/en/), where the OpenSpace on \\"**How to sustain technical communities**\\" that [Dani Rey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-rey-rey-9022702a/), [Oskar Calvo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oskarcalvo) and I have proposed will take place, which will be \\"the continuation\\" of last year\'s Open Space where some of the challenges facing technical communities were discussed.\\n\\n## Communities in recess?\\n\\nAre the communities in recess?, are the communities having more problems now than before?\\n\\nAfter talking to many people, and in different forums, such as the Open Space, my perception is that there is a general feeling about the **drop of activity in many of the technology communities** (both in Spain and abroad) **in the last few years**, especially since the pandemic.\\n\\nBy \\"drop of activity\\" I mean a mix of things, but mainly I mean a lower attendance to meetings (face-to-face and online), interactions in mailing lists/IMs, etc.\\n\\nAnd this situation, worries those of us who energize communities.\\n\\nOne of the concerns that I have heard recurrently is that the average age of the people who are part of these communities is growing, or said with other words, that **it is difficult to attract and engage the new generations**. \\n\\nPersonally, I am reluctant to believe that this is because the experience offered by the communities no longer provides as much value to the new generations as other new formats, channels or \\"forums\\". \\n\\nBut before we continue... what is a community?\\n\\n## What is a community?\\n\\nOr rather, **what do I mean by community, or technology community**?\\n\\nPerhaps it is good to start with this question, since for example, during the Open Space, in my opinion, there were times when the conversation revolved around different concepts of \\"community\\". \\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Vibrant meeting space, technologists gather with faces animated by enthusiasm.](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/user-group-meetup-tech-community.png)](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/user-group-meetup-tech-community.png)\\n\\n</figure>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nIn my case, I talk about what is known as \\"[communities of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice)\\", which in short are **groups of people**(user groups, associations, meetups...) that:\\n\\n* **organize regular meetings** (face-to-face and/or online).\\n* **share a passion / profession / concerns, ... for technology** (software, hardware, methodologies or best practices, ...).\\n* mainly, **seek to collaborate with each other, voluntarily and altruistically**.\\n* they **seek the common benefit** above the particular one (including the particular interest of the organizations that may support/sponsor them).\\n* are **always open to new people**.\\n* feel part of the group and identify with it.\\n\\nSo, I just wanted to clarify that:\\n1. All this is in my experience and is based primarily on the type of communities I just described. \\n2. I believe that most of the ideas and tips shared in [the documents](/docs/category/-tech-communities), can be applied to this type of communities, whether they are local (in small and in big cities), as much as online/virtual, regardless of the fact that each one has its peculiarities.\\n\\nHaving said all of the above, it does not detract from the fact that some of **the tips can also be applied to people who are in the business of disseminating online content, or people who organize large conferences**. \\n\\n## What has changed?\\n\\nWhy do those of us who have been energizing communities have this feeling/perception?\\n\\nTo give some context, I started to get involved with this particular type of communities at the university (in ~2009), and since then [I have participated, contributed, founded and co-organized quite a few communities](https://www.rauljimenez.info/docs/about-me/open-culture#communities), organizing hundreds of meetings (of all kinds).\\n\\nBased on this experience, I would say that the feeling that activity is declining is mainly due to the fact that **it is harder for us to provide value** as we did before.\\n\\nNow the offer is wider and the attention is diversifying with the increase of communities, channels/media (Discords, Slacks, social newtwords, ...), but also the rise of [influencers](https://twitter.com/i/lists/828546487369990144/members). \\n\\n![The image shows a cluttered room, a person hiding behind his hands, drowned between screens and cables.](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/information-saturation-noise-social-networks.png)\\n\\nPersonally I also think that digital contact is eating more ground to the physical, just see that **almost everything is done through apps**: order food, a cab, talk / chat, procedures with the administration, ... even flirting! \ud83d\ude05 and I have no doubt that this also has consequences. \\n\\nThat is why I believe that it is not that communities do not provide value, but that they simply **have to take into account this change of context and reinvent/modernize themselves**. Remember, as Albert Einstein said, \\"_The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results_.\\"\\n\\nI hope that sharing some of the **advice** I heard at the Open Space, and some of my own, will serve to **help refloat some communities and help new ones to emerge**.\\n\\n> A book I really like that talks about adapting to change is [Who Moved My Cheese?](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Spencer-Johnson/dp/0399144463/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=39BAFS7MV20R5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zoT19YfaR2b08zVkjZe2e0OGdTMvrcOsvxtxkGnEU8moy5ou07-LLppVg8nedZprast3hMhTFCJaue9jlJgmw6ZsGnYK7H_L4l-zmECV3z4vsCf3Kb_4qbqZocy25grVymjCcjGOP4h2gaGylJ11DaDG5sN6Kk6FN_eJhS3y2OgVl2kcp5Lpm4xt-0TcK40SOUV0_mJS9wcVA0Nv14Qo0yP1jiKp2qbjKGpntuuDnQY.9rIUivJpeFpsMntNHayamLjJElSNfNsjOGx_HRWO-qw&dib_tag=se&keywords=Who+took+my+cheese%3F&qid=1712813883&sprefix=who+took+my+cheese+%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1) \ud83e\uddc0\ud83d\udc01.\\n\\n## Anatomy of communities\\n\\nAnd before I finish, I wanted to share some ideas and resources to share my understanding of communities.\\n\\nThe most basic are the **degrees of involvement**. I used to explain them this way to my Esri colleagues several years ago (~2017):\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Anatomy of a community diagram](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/anatomy-of-a-community.jpg)](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/anatomy-of-a-community.jpg)\\n\\n<figcaption>Anatomy of a community.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nAfter that, [Jorge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgebarrachina/) taught me several theories:  \\n* The *[Orbit Model](https://orbit.love/model)*, which serves as a model to explain that to increase the feeling of belonging to a group, it is necessary to increase the number of interactions and positive impacts between people, and that bonds are forged.\\n* The [1% rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule), which I use to adjust expectations that no more than ~1% will help to energize, nor ~10% participate, although really **measuring this is often quite subjective, just like trying to measure a friendship** (because at the end of the day, that\'s what they are).\\n* [The Community Maturity Model](https://communityroundtable.com/what-we-do/research/community-maturity-model/), an interesting framework for classifying different types of communities.\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Community Maturity Model -

It is one of the largest [events for developers that is held annually in Spain](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1571289000886910977). It is well attended and draws strong participation from around 50 Spanish technical communities.\\n\\n![Photo of the venue\'s lobby during event registration](./commitconf23-checkin.jpg)\\n\\n## Why attend conferences like CommitConf?\\n\\nAt the conference, developers were brought together to **retrain, discover, and share new insight and knowledge about our profession**. For example, attendees shared information about:\\n\\n* New tools and languages.\\n* New capabilities for the tools and languages already used by the community.\\n* How companies solve different software development challenges.\\n* Best practices in accessibility, security, and design patterns.\\n* New trends.\\n\\nAdditionally, the conference provided a place to meet new people and reconnect with those already known. At events like this, it\u2019s not uncommon to run into people you know! In my case, I bumped into some of my former colleagues, and some developers who use **[ArcGIS to create Location-Aware apps or map applications](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/)**.\\n\\n![Selfies taken by Raul with other developers during the event.](./commitconf23-developers.jpg)\\n\\n## What made this conference special?\\n\\nThis event, like many others, gives us, developers, the opportunity to **present talks, workshops, and even [Open Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology)**.\\n\\nFor attendees, a unique factor that sets this event apart from others is the system used to create the event\u2018s agenda, **allowing the communities themselves to be involved in the selection process of talks**. This system is called [Koliseo](https://koliseo.com/) and is free for anyone to use.\\n\\n## Why submit a proposal?\\n\\nGoing to an event like CommitConf **is an opportunity to learn from and contribute to the developer community**. And, there are many different motivations for a person to send a proposal.\\n\\n* There are people who simply **enjoy sharing knowledge and experiences**. \\n* Other attendees want to **increase the visibility of their company** and to raise awareness of the cool work they do, **with the hope of attracting new talent**. \\n* Some attendees want to **create a personal brand**.\\n* While others want to **discuss and find solutions to a problem with their colleagues**.\\n\\nAnd if you are lucky enough to have a proposal accepted, as in my case, you can **attend the speakers\u2019 dinner** the day before the event, where you meet a lot of experts on different topics \ud83d\ude0d. \\n\\n## What did Esri bring to the conference?\\n\\nFrom the company I work for ([Esri](http://esri.com/)), they have always encouraged me to attend to conferences and to send proposals that I thought might be relevant to other developers.\\n\\nThis time, I presented a variety of proposals:\\n\\n* DataViz & Map Optimization\\n* Designing Beautiful and Intelligent Maps\\n* Using and Creating Collections in Postman Like a Pro\\n* **\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd12 OAuth, OpenID Connect and JWT for Dummies**\\n\\nI was lucky that the conference organizers accepted \u201cOAuth, OpenID Connect, and JWT for Dummies\u201d because it gave me the **opportunity to share what these auth standards are and how they work**. I showed practical examples based on some of the resources that we have created from [Esri\'s Developer Experience team](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VMTWv3XRwWL4zG7rB8SlHkE5XXbd5OW), like the **[Authentication workspace in Postman](https://www.postman.com/esridevs/workspace/authentication-in-arcgis/overview)**.\\n\\n![Photo of Raul\'s talk during his talk on oAuth showing Raul speaking and the audience of about 100 people.](./commitconf23-raul-jimenez-ortega.jpg)\\n\\nIn case you want, you can **[check the slides out here](https://bit.ly/oauth-commit)**. If you are interested in the topic and want me to repeat this talk online, just let me know in the comments!\\n\\n## What did I learn at the conference?\\n\\nBelow are some of the takeaways from the sessions that I attended:\\n\\n* **Local Communities Outside Big Cities (Open Space)**: This session was super interesting. I had the opportunity to share tips and ideas to overcome challenges in creating and maintaining developer communities with approximately thirty other people. Among them were representatives from different communities about Python, Software Crafting, Data, Machine Learning, generalists\u2019 communities, Free Software, GNU/Linux, DevOps, Drupal, and us representing the [GeoDevelopers community](https://meetup.com/es-ES/geo-developers).\\n\\n> **Note**: After the session, I decided to create a guide with what we learned and our own experience. If you are interested, save the article in favourites because we will add it **[here]** in a few weeks.\\n\\n\\n![Photo of the Open Space on communities showing about thirty attendees seated in a circle.](./commitcont23-openspace.jpg)\\n\\n* **Detecting Web Performance Issues with Chrome DevTools**: [@nucliweb](https://twitter.com/nucliweb) gave an overview of the Chrome DevTools and showed us how they keep adding new tools like [Recorder](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/recorder/) and [Coverage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/coverage/) to help evaluate your web performance and optimize it. Also, he showed us how the new AVIF image format improves WebP performance. More info at [web.dev](https://web.dev/).\\n\\n* **Don\u2019t Yell at Me, I Can\u2019t See You**: [@javierabadia](https://twitter.com/javierabadia) and [@jameshedaweng](https://twitter.com/jameshedaweng) explained to us how to divide the responsibilities between an Engineering Manager and a Product Manager to avoid failure when creating a product. In summary, a PM must be responsible for *what* features to add and *why*, and the EM in the *how* and the *who*. The *when* should be a shared responsibility.\\n\\n* **Why I Decided to Pursue the Developer Relations Path**: [@kinisoftware](https://twitter.com/kinisoftware) told us about his experience as a Staff Developer Relations Engineer, where he works to promote the expertise of Criteo\u2019s technical team by facilitating participation in events and communities.\\n\\n* **Testing Web Accessibility**: [@bolonio](https://twitter.com/bolonio) showed us a multitude of tools and resources for testing web accessibility: [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y), [jest-axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe), [axe-core/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/cli), [pa11y](https://pa11y.org/), [pa11y-ci](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci), [axe chrome extension](http://deque.com/axe), [arc toolkit](http://paciellogroup.com/toolkit), [accessibilityinsights.io](http://accessibilityinsights.io/), [wave.webaim.org](https://wave.webaim.org/), and more.\\n\\n* **The Mistake of Becoming a Manager**: [@npatarino](https://twitter.com/npatarino) explained to us that becoming a manager of people is not the only way to have leadership or increase your salary. He said that for those senior software engineers who want to continue growing, there are other positions such as Staff Software Engineer, Principal Software Engineer, Distinguished Software Engineer and Technical Fellow.\\n\\n* **Past, Present and Future of EducaMadrid**: [@asanzdiego](https://twitter.com/asanzdiego) talked to us about the educational platform of the Community of Madrid that he leads; he told us about the technical challenges they suffered during the pandemic, when the number of active users grew exponentially, along with the strengths and limitations of his team and his technological stack based on free software.\\n\\n\\n![Composition of photographs of different sessions attended by Raul.](./commitconf23-techsessions.jpg)\\n\\nIn summary, if you don\'t use to go to developer conferences, **I hope my experience has encouraged you and given you arguments to attend in the future**.

And finally, it also **helps you forget problems sooner or lessen the importance** of many of them.\\n\\nIn short, if someone ever criticizes you for having a bad memory, maybe you can counter-argue that... having a bad memory also has its advantages, what do you think?\\n\\nBy the way, this reasoning also applies to \\"**having scattered attention**,\\" anyone dare to justify the good in this? ^_^"},{"id":"mi-nuevo-trabajo-en-esri","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mi-nuevo-trabajo-en-esri","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2014-04-17/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-04-17/index.md","title":"My new job at Esri","description":"As I mentioned in a previous article, I have joined the Esri Spain team as a Developer Program Manager... and what does that entail?

Well, let me give you several examples:\\n\\n- Identifying the [best areas to live within a city](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://uji.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Filter/index.html?appid=96848387cd1a4ffeaf0bbc1a98699640) (based on certain criteria)\\n- Solving problems like: [what is the best location for my next business?](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.forbes.com/sites/barbarathau/2014/04/24/how-big-data-helps-retailers-like-starbucks-pick-store-locations-an-unsung-key-to-retail-success/)\\n- Creating [location-aware mobile applications](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.fastcolabs.com/3028819/the-big-question-in-retail-now-is-what-are-you-doing-with-geotriggers) that incorporate behaviors associated with their location.\\n- Setting up [dynamic and interactive 3D scenarios](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.arcgis.com/apps/CEWebViewer/viewer.html?3dWebScene=9c0e319bfaff4d33a0fe2da97c2c3fd7) (similar to Second Life)\\n- Representing and communicating large amounts of information in a more understandable ([map of England](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://illustreets.co.uk/explore-england)) or attractive way ([map with incredible places](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/?appid=35926d0e1c7741b59948ca45f4f33b3a)).\\n- [Conducting simulations](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://mappingpoint.blogspot.com.es/2014/01/terremotos-en-la-isla-del-hierro.html), analyzing geolocated data ([e.g., purchases](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://grupoweb.upf.es:8080/quartz/)) and predicting future situations ([queues in stores, etc](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/https://www.centrodeinnovacionbbva.com/en/pages/29293-winners)).\\n- [Other examples](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.geoases.com/inspiracion/)\\n\\nSo, it can be used to solve problems, optimize processes, communicate better, etc., and therefore, the applications are numerous and can be useful for individuals, companies, and governments.\\n\\nIf you are a programmer and are interested in learning more about this field, I invite you to **[join the Geo Developers Meetup](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.meetup.com/Geo-Developers/)** that I created to organize talks, workshops, etc., and help each other by sharing knowledge.\\n\\nSee you soon! ![:D](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438im_/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif)"},{"id":"invertir-en-formacion-online","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/invertir-en-formacion-online","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2014-01-04/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-01-04/index.md","title":"Investing in online training","description":"Many people still hesitate to take the step of paying a fee to subscribe to a good online training service; and today I wanted to advocate for it because I believe it is more cost-effective compared to other formal training alternatives.

Here are a few other platforms with MOOCs that follow this line where you can find free courses (with paid certifications): [Coursera](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://coursera.org/), [Miriadax](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://miriadax.net/), [CodeAcademy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://www.codecademy.com/), and [EDX](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.edx.org/) (_thanks Pino for this last one!_).\\n\\nWell, in my case I pay a **$25 per month** subscription on Codeschool, which over these months (including discounts) has amounted to about \u20ac125, and although this may seem like a considerable amount, I think if we analyze what I\'ve gained in return it offers a different perspective.\\n\\nFor example, during this time I have [completed 9](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/users/227734) of the 36 courses they have available:\\n\\n\u2013 [Javascript Road Trip Part 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1) **(Free)**  \\n\u2013 [Javascript Road Trip Part 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-2)  \\n\u2013 [Javascript Road Trip Part 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-3)  \\n\u2013 [Coffeescript](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/coffeescript)  \\n\u2013 [Real-Time-Web with Node.js](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-nodejs)  \\n\u2013 [Discover DevTools](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/discover-devtools) **(Free)**  \\n\u2013 [Fundamentals of Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/fundamentals-of-design)  \\n\u2013 [Try Git](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) **(Free)**  \\n\u2013 [Try Ruby](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ruby)\\n\\nDoing the math, each paid course has cost me about \u20ac20 and I have invested ... I would say between 4 and 8 hours in each. If we do the math, I think it comes at a very reasonable price since the courses are of tremendous quality and include a lot of practical exercises that I believe **are making me a better professional**.\\n\\nWhat do you think about this, in **comparison to other training options**: workshops, training sessions, master\'s programs, etc. **Don\'t you think it\'s a good price?**"}]}')}}]);
