In this one, we will focus specifically on the era when the Internet became popular, reaching many households, and we will continue to get nostalgic with some of the innovations that were introduced.\\n\\nWe are in the years of:\\n* The [Barcelona Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1992_Summer_Olympics).\\n* The [Seville Expo \'92](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville_Expo_%2792).\\n* The celebration of the first Meeting of Students of Technical and Higher Engineering in Computer Sciences ([RITSI](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuni%C3%B3n_de_Estudiantes_de_Ingenier%C3%ADas_T%C3%A9cnicas_y_Superiores_en_Inform%C3%A1tica)).\\n* The launch of [Windows 3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1).\\n\\nAnd a year before [Intel Pentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium) began flooding the market (1993).\\n\\n:::note\\nOn the radio, and in our [Discman](https://www.xataka.com/musica/cuando-el-discman-mp3-conquisto-brevemente-nuestras-vidas), songs like \\"Experiencia Religiosa\\" by Enrique Iglesias (1995), \\"Wannabe\\" by the Spice Girls (1996), \\"La Raja de Tu Falda\\" by Estopa (1999), or \\"Livin\' la Vida Loca\\" by Ricky Martin were playing.\\n:::\\n\\n## Linux and LUGs\\n\\nA year earlier, in 1991, [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) was created, a operating system that in 1992 adopted a GPL license. This technology not only transformed the Internet and many other things, but it was also the seed of many important communities of the time, such as the [**Linux user groups**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_user_group) (**LUGs**). Among other things, they held \u201c*Linux install parties*\u201d to help install systems like SUSE (1992), Debian (1993), Red Hat (1993), Mandrake (1998), ... which were not easy to get working at that time.\\n\\nYears later, in 1997, the **Association of Spanish Linux Users** ([Hispalinux](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispalinux)) was formed in Spain, an important community whose goals can be read in [their statutes](https://hispalinux.es/Estatutos).\\n\\n## Internet\\n\\nThis is the era of the [early days of the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRAME#Evolution) [in Spain (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIuLQACGiaI), when Web 1.0 arrives, static pages created with HTML 2.0, practically without user systems or comments, and which we browse with browsers like [Netscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape) or [Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_(web_browser)).\\n\\n:::note\\nDue to the limitations of JavaScript in 1996, there were technologies like Microsoft\'s [ActiveX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveX), Sun Microsystems\' [JavaBeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaBeans), and [Macromedia Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash), which allowed for more advanced experiences.\\n:::\\n\\nThe first [Internet Service Providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) like [Goya](https://www.eldiario.es/hojaderouter/internet/goya-servicios-telematicos-internet-upm-eunet-rediris_1_3845405.html) (1992) and [InfoV\xeda](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfoV%C3%ADa) (1995) were born, charging for Internet (per minute connected) at the price of a local phone call. Yes, because at that time, you had to pay for local calls. That\'s when 28.8 kbps modems, **the routers of that time, were more than a thousand times slower than today\'s**.\\n\\nWith these connections, we could chat and browse Web 1.0. At that time, websites almost had no images, and of course, no multimedia files, because downloading a 4 MB file could take many hours, and if you were lucky that someone didn\'t cut off your connection by calling your house.\\n\\n:::note\\nSoon after, audio and video compression algorithms, or [codecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_codecs) and [video codecs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_video_codecs#Codecs_list) improved significantly, facilitating access to these files online (e.g. MP3 1993, AAC 1997, DivX 1998, MP4 2001, ...).\\n:::\\n\\nAlso in 1992, [party lines](https://www.xataka.com/historia-tecnologica/una-historia-de-pioneros-ya-ligaban-discutian-y-daban-likes-en-las-party-lines-de-los-90) emerged, multi-conferences with strangers via telephone. Although personally, I wouldn\'t include this in the community initiatives.\\n\\nIn 1998, another community was born, the **[Association of Internauts](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asociaci%C3%B3n_de_Internautas)**, whose [objectives are here](https://www.internautas.org/pagweb/3.html).\\n\\nAnd in 2000, the **[Spanish chapter of the Internet Society](https://www.internetsociety.org/es/chapters/)** was founded.\\n\\n:::note\\nDid you know that at the beginning of the Internet, it was the Internet providers themselves who usually provided us with our email accounts? Before Microsoft launched Hotmail in 1996 (now known as Outlook), or Yahoo! created Yahoo Mail in 1998, or Google inaugurated Gmail in 2004, which by the way, you could only access by invitation.\\n:::\\n\\n## Hosting and Search Engines\\n\\nWhen the Internet was arriving in Spain, the first web hosting providers, like [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) (1994), or later [Galeon.com](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispavista) (1999), began offering free web hosting as well.\\n\\n**This greatly reduced the barrier to entry for communities that wanted to collaborate by creating and sharing tutorials, news, etc.** Especially for those of us who were teenagers and couldn\'t afford a paid one.\\n\\nIt should also be noted that the first [search engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine) did not appear until the mid-90s (e.g. [Lycos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycos) \u201894, [Yahoo! Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Search) \u201895, [AltaVista](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AltaVista) \u201895, [Ol\xe9](https://www.xataka.com/historia-tecnologica/que-fue-ole-primer-gran-buscador-espanol-historia-fugaz-marcada-crecimiento-brutal-polemica) \u201896, [Hispavista](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispavista) \u201896, [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search) \u201897\u2026). Therefore, there were not only far fewer manuals and tutorials, but until then, it had been very difficult to find them.\\n\\n:::note\\n1995 is also the year when [Amazon launched one of the first online stores](https://www.versionmuseum.com/history-of/amazon-website). Here is the [Amazon on Kiro 7 News in 1997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmTNWynx7VQ) documentary.\\n:::\\n\\nAs a result of some of these collaborations, older people will remember the famous [Rinc\xf3n del Vago](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rinc%C3%B3n_del_Vago) (~1998), a website mainly used by students to share academic papers and notes. But to give an example of a technical community, I will leave one that I was lucky enough to be a part of, [HackHispano](https://foro.hackhispano.com/threads/46039-HACKHISPANO-cumple-20-a%C3%B1os) (~1999).\\n\\n## IRC and Other Chats\\nIt was also when the [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC) protocol became popular, and programs like [mIRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRC) (1995) to connect to [public servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC#Timeline) like [IRC-Hispano](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC-Hispano), [freenode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode), [undernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undernet), etc. **for the first time in history**, it allowed **real-time chatting** with people from other parts of the world, I repeat, at the cost of a local call, something totally disruptive.\\n\\n:::note\\nFor the new generations; IRC is similar to Slack, Discord, etc. But where public servers gathered tens or hundreds of thousands of people, where anyone could create a \\"Room,\\" and whoever arrived first automatically became an *IRC operator* with moderation permissions. By the way, [there are still communities that continue to use IRC](https://x.com/hhkaos/status/1803719231659294820) as a communication tool \ud83d\ude09.\\n:::\\n\\nThere were many channels about #linux, #programming, #networks, ... but also #humor, #madrid, #manga, etc. However, it is true that many historic hacker communities like [!Hispahack](https://www.microsiervos.com/archivo/hackers/hispahack.html)/#hispahack (~1996) also started to gather here. In this [interview with Antonio Fernandes](https://youtu.be/uhcTvvpy1T8?si=tbN6mYoCBxohItNA&t=234) (in The Wild Project), you can hear about his beginnings in hacking at that time, and how he mentions other hacker communities/groups like [Ap\xf3stols](https://hackstory.net/Apostol.html) or [La Vieja Guardia](https://hackstory.net/La_Vieja_Guardia.html).\\n\\n:::info\\nThe movie [Hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_(film)) released in 1995, explores the *hacker* and *cyberpunk* subcultures and shows [black hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker#Black_hat) hackers involved in a corporate extortion conspiracy.\\n:::\\n\\nIn 1996, the newsgroup [es.comp.os.linux](http://www.escomposlinux.org/) was born, dedicated to discussing the Linux operating system in Spain, and according to [hackstory.net](https://hackstory.net/Es.comp.os.linux.html), one of the main initiatives of Spanish Linux hackers.\\n\\n:::note\\nDuring this time, other messaging and VoIP tools like [ICQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ) (1996), [Terra chats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(company)) (1999), [MSN Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_Messenger) (1999), [Skype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype) (2003) also became popular in Spain. Although I wouldn\'t say many community communications emerged around them.\\n:::\\n\\n## Conferences\\n\\nAt that time, the main technological conferences in Spain were:\\n* [SIMO TCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMO_TCI) (1994).\\n* [Computing Days of the Spanish Association of Computing and Automation](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (1995-1998).\\n* [Hispalinux Congress](https://web.archive.org/web/20010513202506/http://congreso.hispalinux.es/) (1998).\\n\\nIn the international scene, other popular conferences started:\\n* [Microsoft Professional Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_Developers_Conference) (1992).\\n* [DEF CON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEF_CON) (1993).\\n* [Hackers on Planet Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers_on_Planet_Earth) (1994).\\n* [Linux Kongress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Kongress) (1994).\\n* [JavaOne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaOne) (1996).\\n* [O\u2019Reilly Conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Reilly_Media#Conferences) (1997).\\n* [FOSDEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM) (2001).\\n* etc.\\n\\n## Mailing Lists\\n\\nAlso at that time, **communities that gathered around mailing lists increased considerably**:\\n* Hispalinux.\\n* Lists of Linux user groups.\\n* [RedIRIS distribution lists](https://www.rediris.es/list/).\\n* etc.\\n\\n:::note\\nAt that time, there were already [mailing lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailing_list#See_also) like [LISTSERV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LISTSERV). In 1992, [Majordomo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majordomo_(software)) was created as freeware, and later [GNU Mailman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Mailman) (1999). It wasn\'t until 2001 that [Google Groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Groups) was launched, another system that gave a strong boost to mailing lists among communities.\\n:::\\n\\n## LAN Parties\\n\\nThis is the era of the first [LAN parties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN_party), groups of friends who gathered at someone\'s house to play network games and sometimes see things we shouldn\'t \ud83e\udd23.\\n\\nAlso, macro gatherings like the [Euskal Party](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euskal_Encounter) (1993) or [Campus Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_Party) (1996) began, where many of us took our desktop computers, got on a bus, and traveled across Spain to spend a few days surrounded by hundreds or thousands of technology enthusiasts playing games, burning CDs, etc.\\n\\n:::note\\nIn 1994, the first [CD burners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_disc_drive) arrived, causing an unprecedented increase in piracy in Spain. Years later, [Napster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster) (1999), eDonkey ([2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDonkey2000)), [eMule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMule) (2002), ... and other technologies that would further boost it emerged.\\n:::\\n\\nA few years later, in 1998, the **video game and multimedia developer community [Stratos](https://stratos-ad.com/nosotros)** emerged.\\n\\n:::note\\nIn 1999, the program [Roger Wilco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Wilco_(software)) appeared, software that revolutionized VoIP communications among the gaming community.\\n:::\\n\\n## Cybercaf\xe9s\\n\\nWith the arrival of [ISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDN), which significantly improved Internet connection speeds, the first [Internet caf\xe9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_caf%C3%A9) ([~1995](https://www.businessinsider.es/historia-ciberteca-primer-cibercafe-toda-espana-647001)) began to emerge. These became other meeting points where groups of friends would gather to play, talk, and share things they had discovered on the Internet, etc., and where some \u201chackers\u201d \ud83d\ude1c took advantage of installing [keyloggers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging) and [trojan horses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_(computing))) for somewhat illicit purposes.\\n\\n:::note\\nAround 1999, [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi) (or 802.11 protocol) [became popular in Spain](https://www.telefonica.com/es/sala-comunicacion/noticias/el-wifi-cumple-22-anos-y-alberga-dos-tercios-del-trafico-de-internet-en-espana/), which was the year the [Wi-Fi Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance) registered the brand.\\n:::\\n\\n## Bloggers\\n\\nAt the end of the millennium, in 1999, blogs, formerly also called [weblogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog), began to gain popularity, perhaps triggered by the launch of [Blogger.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_(service)).\\n\\nIn that same year, [Barrapunto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrapunto) (1999) was born, a news website related to free software, technology, and digital rights. In 2001, it began offering a weblog system called MiBarrapunto.\\n\\nA famous blog that started talking about free culture at that time was [Ignacio Escolar\'s](https://web.archive.org/web/20030212231211/http://escolar.net/) (~2001).\\n\\nThen [Blogalia](https://web.archive.org/web/20030409203240/http://www.blogalia.com/historias/3) (~2001/2002) was born, another weblog server in Spanish.\\n\\nWhat I would like to comment on here is the fact that **the comments on *some* blogs almost became community chats**.\\n\\n:::info\\nIn 2003, [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress) was created, and Blogger.com was acquired and relaunched by Google.\\n:::\\n\\n## End of the Era\\n\\nAccording to the [Scientific Computing Society of Spain](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/), it is estimated that by the end of the century, a total of about 68,705 people had graduated in computing in Spain (~2450 per year).\\n\\nIt is also when the first [Official Colleges of Computer Engineers](https://www.cpitia.org/el-colegio/ingenieria-tecnica-informatica/historia/#La_ingenieria_tecnica_informatica_como_profesion_sujeta_a_especial_control) (e.g. Murcia, Catalonia, Asturias, ...) (1998-2002) began to be formed, and when the [Association of Women Researchers and Technologists](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asociaci%C3%B3n_de_Mujeres_Investigadoras_y_Tecn%C3%B3logas) (2001) emerged.\\n\\n:::note\\nAt this time, [phone booths](https://www.movistar.es/blog/home/cabina-telefonica-historia-cabinas-espana/) were still being used, although Internet and GSM coverage was growing rapidly. Operators like Telef\xf3nica, Airtel, Amena, ... opened the telecommunications market, and Nokia launched the popular [Nokia 3310](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_3310). But despite everything, SMS and voice calls still dominated communications.\\n\\nIt is also when we experienced the [dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) burst (~2001). A year later, Amazon would start the cloud revolution by creating [AWS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Web_Services).\\n:::\\n\\n## International Scene\\n\\nNow let\'s review other events that happened internationally and later had an impact on technical communities in Spain.\\n\\n### Hackerspaces\\n\\nAround 1992, [hackerspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) began to emerge, physical spaces where people interested in new technologies, electronics, digital arts, etc. met, socialized, and collaborated.\\n\\n### Other Communities\\n\\nIn 1993, [the IBM community appears](https://youtu.be/vIW1GUcmN2s?si=RZ51utbBGo_xAbdm&t=776).\\n\\nThe same year the first version of [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) was released (1995), one of the first [Java Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/denverjavausersgroup/) (the Denver one) was formed.\\n\\nThen in 2001, many things happened:\\n\\n* [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia) was created, around which a vast community of contributors would emerge (including [local communities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikimedia_chapters)).\\n* The [Python Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Software_Foundation) was born, which would foster the creation of [local user groups](https://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups), now boasting over 1600 groups and more than 800,000 members.\\n* And the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks) occurred.\\n\\n:::note\\nAccording to Wikipedia, these attacks led to the creation of [Meetup.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meetup) in 2002, a platform that originally aimed to bring together people with common hobbies and interests, and which would later be widely used by technical communities.\\n:::\\n\\n### Recognitions\\n\\nI found that around 1993, [Microsoft was already recognizing some developers\' contributions](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/brief-history-microsoft-mvp-program-hal-hostetler-3rggc/), which could be considered the precursor to the Microsoft MVP program, and what in the future would likely lead to other programs of \\"*champions*\\", \\"*ambassadors*\\", etc.\\n\\n:::note\\nThese programs recognizing developers\' contributions would be seen as highly useful by professionals to develop personal branding, a concept introduced by Tom Peters in 1997 and which would become popular in Spain a few years later.\\n:::\\n\\n### Open Culture\\n\\nTwelve years after the founding of the Free Software Foundation (in 1997), developer Bruce Perens created [The Open Source Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition) and a year later co-founded the [Open Source Initiative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Initiative), which popularized the term \\"*open source*\\" and advocated for open-source software from a pragmatic and business-friendly perspective.\\n\\n:::note\\nTo date, the most iconic example of a company based on free software is [Red Hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat), although years later, around 2008, other (controversial) models like open-core would become popular.\\n:::\\n\\nEarly initiatives focused on [open-source hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware), such as the \\"[Open Hardware Certification Program](https://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/1997/msg00026.html)\\" and the \\"[Open Hardware Specification Project](https://web.archive.org/web/19981212031618/http://www.openhardware.org/)\\" were also launched around that time.\\n\\nIn 1999, the [Apache Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Apache_Software_Foundation) was created to support various open-source software projects. And one of the first websites offering free hosting for the developer community to share open-source projects, [Sourceforge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge), was launched.\\n\\nIn 2000, the [Open Source Development Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Development_Labs) was founded to promote Linux in enterprise computing, which years later (in 2007) would become the [Linux Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Foundation).\\n\\nIt was also during this time (2001) that Lawrence Lessig, a lawyer, and political activist, created [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons), an organization dedicated to facilitating access to educational content and increasing the amount of creative works available for others to legally build upon and share.\\n\\n### Social Networks\\n\\nWe could say that the beginnings of social networks also occurred at the end of this era with the birth of:\\n\\n* [SixDegrees.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SixDegrees.com) (~1998)\\n* [Last.fm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last.fm) (2002)\\n* [Friendster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendster) (2003)\\n* [MySpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace) (2003)\\n* [LinkedIn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn) (2003)\\n* [Hi5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hi5) (2004)\\n* Etc.\\n\\nAlthough out of all these, I would say the only well-known ones in Spain were MySpace and perhaps Last.fm, mainly for communities around music.\\n\\n## Conclusions\\n\\nIn this era, we can undoubtedly say that **online communities exploded, mainly with text interactions, mailing lists, and blog comments**. Although voice calls (among gamers primarily) also began.\\n\\nProfessional associations and those around different technologies continued to be created, but now they were not necessarily local. Some new conferences emerged, but they were still not very common.\\n\\n**Some communities emerged around topics like** Internet, Linux, hacking, game programming, women in technology, digital journalism, hardware (e.g. overclocking, open hardware, ...), etc.\\n\\nBased on this information, I would say that at this time, a community was understood as: a group of people who gathered (online or in person), voluntarily and on their own initiative, sharing an interest in technology, to collaborate with each other."},{"id":"first-associations-and-online-communities","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/first-associations-and-online-communities","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2024-07-06/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-06/index.md","title":"1\ufe0f\u20e3

 \\n</p>\\n</details>\\n\\nIn this first article of the series \\"[History of technical communities](../2024-07-05/index.md),\\" we will review the history of technical communities in Spain, before the Internet, during the era when computing arrived and the revolution of [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_personal_computers) began.\\n\\n## Previous context\\n\\nLet\'s review some facts from the national and international context to set the stage.\\n\\n### United States\\n\\n1975 is the year when the United States ended the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War).\\n\\n[IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM) was already 64 years old, the giant and world leader in manufacturing computers ([mainframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer)) used by companies, government institutions, and academia.\\n\\nBy this time, some of the first [user groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Users%27_group) or communities I could find were already a few years old, such as:\\n\\n- [TMRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club), MIT students related to hacking culture (1946).\\n- [SHARE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing)), IBM mainframe user group (1955).\\n- [GUIDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUIDE_International), an IBM systems user group (1956).\\n- [DECUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECUS), the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) computer user group (1961).\\n\\nIn 1963, the [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers) was created, a non-profit organization that would later create standards such as [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3) (1983), [Wi-Fi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11) (1997), etc.\\n\\nBy then, some notable computing conferences that brought together technical profiles had already been held, such as the [International Solid-State Circuits Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Solid-State_Circuits_Conference) (1954) and the [Symposium on Operating Systems Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_on_Operating_Systems_Principles) (1967).\\n\\nOn the other hand, Intel, already 7 years old, launched the first microprocessor in 1971, the [Intel 4004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_4004) (at a cost of $450, as of 2023), which would revolutionize the personal computer industry.\\n\\n### Spain\\n\\nNow let\'s review some important facts related to computing in Spain before the dictator [Francisco Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Franco) died in 1975 after 36 years in power.\\n\\nUp to that date, the most notable figure in the sector I have found is [Jos\xe9 Garc\xeda Santesmases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Garc%C3%ADa_Santesmases), a physicist and pioneer of computing in Spain who was 68 years old that year. He:\\n\\n- Created the Institute of Electricity and Automation (1952).\\n- Organized an [international automation congress](https://web.archive.org/web/20140607041251/https://www.scie.es/historia-progreso-informatica-cientifica-universitaria-espana/congresos-informatica-cientifica-universitaria/) (1958).\\n- Created the Spanish Association of Computing and Automation (AEIA) (1967).\\n- Organized the [First National Congress of Automation](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (1970).\\n    \\nIt was also before Franco\'s death that the [Association of Computing Technicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Engineers_Association_of_Spain) (1967) and the [Institute of Computing](https://www.fi.upm.es/web/historia/institutodeinformatica/) under the Ministry of Education and Science (1969) were created.\\n\\nIn 1971, an order (law) was approved in Spain, and that would establish the study plans for [the different degrees](https://www.cpitia.org/el-colegio/ingenieria-tecnica-informatica/historia/), which shortly afterwards would give rise to the first Faculties of Computer Science.\\n\\n## The Spanish transition\\n\\nThe same year Franco died, in the United States, Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft) and launched what is considered the first personal computer that was well-received by the market (in terms of performance/price ratio), the [Altair 8800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altair_8800).\\n\\nIn this year (1975), the mythical [Homebrew Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club) was also founded, where Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs showed their [Apple 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I) in 1976, a moment \u201cimmortalized\u201d in movies like [Pirates of Silicon Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley) ([see sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxthr3fq-EI)) or [Jobs (2013)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jobs_(film)).\\n\\nIn 1976, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne founded [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.), and launched the [Apple-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I). The same year Bill Gates wrote his famous letter \u201c[An Open Letter to Hobbyists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Open_Letter_to_Hobbyists)\u201d.\\n\\n:::note\\nThe first film documenting the Apple-Microsoft rivalry, [Pirates of Silicon Valley](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirates_of_Silicon_Valley), was not released until 1999.\\n:::\\n\\n\\n\\nThat year was when the first Computer Sciences Faculties were created in Spain at the Polytechnic Universities of Madrid and Barcelona, and the University of Valladolid ([see more](https://www.cpitia.org/el-colegio/ingenieria-tecnica-informatica/historia/#:~:text=El%20Decreto%20593%2F1976%2C%20de,su%20centro%20de%20San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n.)).\\n\\n## First associations\\n\\nOn June 15, 1977, the first democratic elections were held in Spain.\\n\\nShortly after, the **[Constitution of Spain (1978)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Spain)** was approved, which among many other things **includes the right to [freedom of association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_association)**, which would promote the formation of many associations in Spain from which articles, manuals, and case studies would be published.\\n\\nSome of these associations are:\\n\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Association of Graduates in Computing Engineering](https://www.ali.es/presentacion/) (1980).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Spanish Association for Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis](https://www.aerfai.org/) (1982).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aepia.org/historia_aepia/) (1983).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Spanish Society for Natural Language Processing](http://www.sepln.org/) (1984).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Ada Spain Association](http://www.adaspain.org/) (1987).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Association for the Development of Educational Computing](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (1989).\\n\\nIn parallel, outside Spain, other notable groups were formed:\\n- \ud83c\udde9\ud83c\uddea [Chaos Computer Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Computer_Club), a hackers association (1981).\\n- \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 [Macintosh User Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_User_Group) (1984).\\n- \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 [Apple User Group Connection (AUGC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_User_Group_Connection) (1985), [promotional video from 1991](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkvtERqJnp0).\\n\\n## First online communities\\nAlso, around this time (early 80s), the first online communities could be said to emerge, gathering around bulletin board systems ([BBS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system)), the precursors to today\'s forums.\\n\\nAlmost in parallel, [Usenet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet) emerged (~1980), another system for exchanging opinions and experiences. This is the system [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman#GNU_project) used in 1983 to announce his plan for the [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU) operating system. Two years later, in 1985, he founded the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation), whose philosophy would have a significant impact on the world of software and soon after on hardware, and of course around many technical communities.\\n\\nShortly after Usenet, in the year when [Teletext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletext) was being experimented with in Spain and we could listen to Michael Jackson\'s recently released Thriller on the [walkmans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman) (1982), Telef\xf3nica began marketing [Minitel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minitel), a system that could be used to access the phone book, retail shopping, access company information services, databases, forums, and messaging.\\n\\nIn that same year (1982), [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) was founded, where in 1991 they would start working on the project that would result in the [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)) language.\\n\\nIn 1984, [FidoNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FidoNet) emerged, a popular network of BBS nodes that would gain traction in Spain and for the first time allow many strangers to communicate worldwide via computers over telephone lines. For example, the node \\"2:345/801\\" was the address of a board called \u201c[Atlantis](https://groups.google.com/g/soc.culture.spain/c/jGLymQIac3I)\u201d whose operator was Alfredo Sanchez, from Granada, and whose phone number was \u201c958132748\u201d. More information in \\"[Traveling in time: SysOp of a BBS in 1997 and Fidonet in Spain](https://carrero.es/sysop-de-una-bbs-fidonet-1997/)\\". Here is another list of [nodes from 1987](http://www.textfiles.com/fidonet-on-the-internet/n1987/nodelist.289), and here are [other nodes from Spain](https://www.cyberiada.org/r34.htm).\\n\\n## Conferences\\n\\nIn the national scene, most of the technical conferences and events held were more from the university sector:\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Automation Days](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comit%C3%A9_Espa%C3%B1ol_de_Autom%C3%A1tica) of the Spanish Automation Committee (1977).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [IV National Congress of Computing and Automation](https://www.ceautomatica.es/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/50-ANIVERSARIO-DEL-CEA_1967-2017.pdf) (AEIA) (1979).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [V Congress of Computing and Automation](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (AEIA) (1982).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [Congress of the Spanish Association for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.aepia.org/caepia/) (1985).\\n- \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddf8 [VI Congress of Computing and Automation](https://www.scie.es/inicios-informatica-en-espana/) (AEIA) (1985).\\n\\nAnd in the United States, here are some that seemed interesting to highlight:\\n- \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 [History of Programming Languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Programming_Languages_(conference)) (1978)\\n- \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 [IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_Symposium_on_Security_and_Privacy) (1980)\\n- \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 [Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_Developers_Conference) (WWDC) (1983)\\n\\n## PCs and video games\\n\\nThroughout this decade (the 80s), [386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I386) (1985) and [486](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I486) (1989) computers arrived in many Spanish homes, and video game consoles began to flood houses: [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) (1982), [Nintendo NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) (1983), [Sega SG-1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SG-1000) (1983) [Amstrad CPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC) (1984), [Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) (1985), [Atari 7800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_7800) (1986), [Game Boy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy) (1989), ... In this climate, the first meeting called the [Game Developers Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Developers_Conference) was organized in 1988, in California, with about 20 people that would grow to about 125 the following year, and today gathers nearly 28,000 people.\\n\\n## End of the era\\n\\nOther relevant events at the end of this era:\\n\\n- [RedIRIS](https://www.rediris.es/rediris/historia/index.html.es) (1988) emerged in Spain, the Interconnection Network of Computing Resources for universities and research centers.\\n- [Guy Kawasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Kawasaki) created a team of evangelists at Apple.\\n- The popular [Concurrent Versions System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System) (CVS) was born (1990).\\n- Also in 1990, Open Design Circuits proposed the creation of a hardware design community with the spirit of free software ([more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_hardware)).\\n- Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger introduced the concept of \u201c[Community of Practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice)\u201d that accompanies us to this day and is defined as: \u201ca group of people who share an interest, deepen their knowledge and experience in the area through continuous interaction that strengthens their relationships\u201d (1991).\\n\\nFinally, what would change society and the community ecosystem in the coming years was presented by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) in 1991, the foundations of the World Wide Web.\\n\\n## Conclusions\\n\\nAs we have observed, during this era, computing arrived in Spain, along with the constitution and the first associations, which emerged around the scientific and university community.\\n\\n- The first computing, automation, and artificial intelligence conferences were held. At the same time, BBS and Usenet emerged, where the first more informal online communities began to form.\\n- Internationally, the first user groups and computer hobbyist clubs emerged around electronics, specific company systems, hacking... along with some conferences that were mainly face-to-face.\\n\\n**In summary, these groups and conferences talked about**: operating systems, automation, robotics, circuits, programming languages, artificial intelligence, IBM systems, Apple, video games, networks, and security.\\n\\nBased on this information, I would say that when we talked about community in Spain at this time, we mainly referred to: a group of people who meet in person on their own initiative and share an interest in software, whose goal is professional development. Mainly to publish articles, manuals, and case studies.\\n\\nAnd you, what do you think?\\n\\nIf you liked it...

It is mainly aimed at people with experience or the intention to create technical communities, with the purpose of **helping to create healthier, more attractive, useful, and sustainable communities**.\\n\\nIn this context, I find myself needing to define what a technical community is, at least for me.\\n\\n## An ambiguous term\\n\\nTo begin with, I hope everyone agrees with me that the term *[community](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/community)* not only has many meanings and synonyms, but it has been used to refer to many things, sometimes more accurately and sometimes less so, making it very ambiguous.\\n\\nFor example, when we talk about a community, we could be referring to a multitude of things (at least in Spanish):\\n\\n- A [collective](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/collective) \\n- A [guild](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/gremio)\\n- A [group](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/group?m=form) (e.g., [mutual aid group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_aid), group of users/customers, ...)\\n- A [club](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/club?m=form) (e.g., [book discussion club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_discussion_club), [fan club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_club)\\n- A [tribe](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/tribu?m=form)\\n- A [gang](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/pandilla?m=form)\\n- A [sect](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/secta?m=form), [clan](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/clan?m=form), or [The Fellowship of the Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring) \ud83d\ude02\\n- ...\\n\\nIn the tech world, the term has been used, and we could even say... abused or misused to the point where some of us feel that the romantic meaning of the word has been distorted.\\n\\nHere are some illustrative examples in different contexts:\\n\\n- **The community of a technology** <br/>(e.g., [Python community](https://www.python.org/community/), [Java community](https://dev.java/community/), [Android community](https://developer.android.com/community), \u2026)\\n- **The community of a platform** <br/> (e.g., [GitHub community](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines), [Twitch community](https://meetups.twitch.tv/), Stack Overflow, Reddit, Meetup\u2026)\\n- **The external community of a brand or organization** <br/> (e.g., [GDG community](https://developers.google.com/community-guidelines), [GDE](https://developers.google.com/community/experts), [Microsoft](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/community), [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines), [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/communities), [CodelyTV](https://codely.com/)...)\\n- **The internal community (of employees) of a brand or organization** <br/> (e.g., [SNGULAR](https://x.com/jlvallejo/status/1785255285709312510), ...)\\n- **The community of an influencer** <br/> (e.g., [Midudev](https://discord.com/servers/midudev-aprende-y-mejora-en-programacion-741237973663612969), [mouredev](https://github.com/mouredev/Monthly-App-Challenge-2022), ...)\\n- **The community of a movement, practice, or methodology** <br/> (e.g., [Open source community](https://github.com/open-source), [Agile community](https://www.agilealliance.org/communities/), ...)\\n- **The community of an event/conference** <br/> (e.g., [Codemotion](https://community-es.codemotion.it/comunidad), ...)\\n- **The community of a field or guild** <br/> (e.g., Frontend, Backend, DevOps, ...)\\n- ...\\n\\nThis often leads to debates about what we generally mean by community in the tech world.\\n\\nKeep in mind that language evolves over time, and the use of words is closely linked to the context in which they are expressed. To dig a bit more into this, I\u2019ve decided to start a series of articles on the [History of technical communities (in Spain)](../2024-07-05/index.md).\\n\\n## My definition\\n\\nHere\u2019s what I understand by technical community, in the most traditional/romantic sense, heavily influenced by [my own life experience](https://www.rauljimenez.info/docs/about-me/my-journey), and clearly biased:\\n\\nIt is a **group of people** who:\\n\\n- Emerge from **their own initiative** ([grassroots movement](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Movimiento_de_bases)).\\n- **Share an interest in technology** (software or hardware), for example: programming languages, methodologies, cybersecurity, data, or robotics.\\n- **Are governed by a set of norms** or rules, whether implicit or explicit (like a code of conduct, decalogue, nettiquete, ...) and **defined by the community itself**.\\n- Have a **purpose** or goal more focused on **professional or personal development** rather than pure entertainment.\\n\\nWhere all these people, both promoters and other participants, voluntarily decide to invest part of their **free time** (out of intrinsic motivation), and sometimes money, to interact regularly with each other. Sometimes without expecting anything more than the satisfaction of helping others, sharing knowledge, sharing experiences, learning from others, collaborating on projects, and ultimately **enjoying with like-minded people their passion for technology in their free time**.\\n\\nAlways **altruistically**, and even seeking the good of others at their own expense, often leading to the **formation of strong bonds**.\\n\\nIf I had to name some communities that I think would fit quite well, they would be:\\n- [!Hispahack](https://www.microsiervos.com/archivo/hackers/hispahack.html)\\n- [Hispalinux](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispalinux)\\n- [Local Python communities](https://es.python.org/comunidades/)\\n- [HOT communities](https://www.hotosm.org/community/)\\n- etc.\\n\\nThat said, I must say that:\\n- This definition probably does not apply to more than 90% of the communities that exist today.\\n- Nor does it mean I do not appreciate or admire other types of communities.\\n\\n## The controversy\\n\\nThe other day, thinking about some classic debates where people from the same generation discussed whether \u201cX\u201d was a community or not, I remembered when my father used to tell me: \u201c*what you\u2019re listening to isn\u2019t music, it\u2019s noise!*\u201d Does that sound familiar? Personally, I think it\u2019s natural that as we get older, we hang on to our memories and nostalgia for something, and it\u2019s hard for us to accept that things change and evolve into something that we may or may not like.\\n\\nAnd more often than I\u2019d like, I find myself in similar debates: is an online community a real community? Is the community of a company a community? Is the community of X a community?, ...\\n\\n## What really matters\\n\\nBut I wonder, how important is the label we put on it?\\n\\nMy opinion is quite firm on this. I say that, as always, the most important thing is to seek what unites us and not what separates us. We are already in a sufficiently divided, confrontational, and polarized society, to add more fuel to the fire over things that, in my opinion... are [trivialities](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trivialities).\\n\\nJust like people, communities are diverse; you may like them more or less, and everyone will judge which people and communities they like better, seem healthier, or toxic, but in any case, what I say is... let\u2019s try to empathize, always act with respect, sincerity, honesty, and as far as possible... collaborate.\\n\\nIn my opinion, this is the antidote to most problems.\\n\\nAnd you, what do you think?"},{"id":"learn-to-teach-your-kids","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/learn-to-teach-your-kids","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2024-06-01/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-01/index.md","title":"\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Learn to teach (your kids)","description":"It\'s been a long time since I wrote about these topics...","date":"2024-06-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 1, 2024","tags":[{"label":"guide","permalink":"/blog/tags/guide"},{"label":"handbook","permalink":"/blog/tags/handbook"},{"label":"community","permalink":"/blog/tags/community"},{"label":"user groups","permalink":"/blog/tags/user-groups"},{"label":"meetups","permalink":"/blog/tags/meetups"}],"readingTime":8.91,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Raul Jimenez Ortega","title":"Principal Product Engineer, DevRel @ Esri","url":"https://github.com/hhkaos","imageURL":"https://github.com/hhkaos.png","key":"hhkaos"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"learn-to-teach-your-kids","title":"\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udfeb Learn to teach (your kids)","authors":["hhkaos"],"tags":["guide","handbook","community","user groups","meetups"],"image":"/img/blogs/aprendiendo-a-aprender/learn-to-teach-your-kids.png","enableComments":true},"prevItem":{"title":"\ud83d\udc65 What is a technical community?","permalink":"/blog/what-is-a-technical-community"},"nextItem":{"title":"\ud83d\udce6 Resources for technical communities","permalink":"/blog/resources-for-community-leaders"}},"content":"<details><summary>It\'s been a long time since I wrote about these topics...</summary>\\n<p>\\n\\nSpecifically since I launched the [family blog attempt](https://familiajimenezcano.wordpress.com/) (in 2018), although I hope to find time another day to share these experiences. \\n\\nThe truth is that I would like to share how I am trying to get involved in my son\'s school.

For example:\\n  * In January, one with a beautiful cover\\n  * In February, one with illustrations\\n  * In March, another with a number in the title\\n  * In April, one turned into a movie\\n  * In May, one with an author from your country\\n  * In June, a graphic novel/comic.\\n\\nAlthough most books are recommended for children his age, in some ways it surprises me:\\n  * The length of the books, especially for **the pace at which they have to read**. Although I suppose it is good because **it requires them to read almost daily a chapter**, which will help them develop a reading habit.\\n  * **The vocabulary contained in the books**, sometimes quite advanced, which is good, I suppose.\\n\\n:::note\\nHere\'s a talk (in Spanish) that my good friend Jorge Barrachina recommended to me recently, Gregorio Luri\'s talk \\"[El arte de leer y el gusto por la lectura](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UtwJHkhJ0s)\\".\\n:::\\n\\nBut I would like to know if I am the only one or if other families also have similar feelings. I encourage you to tell me in the [comments](#comments) \ud83d\ude1c.\\n\\n\x3c!-- \\n:::note\\n\\n::: --\x3e\\n\\n## The frustration\\n\\nIt all starts when after several weeks, after reading my son\'s summaries looking for spelling mistakes, **I realize that I don\'t understand the summaries very well**. So, with the idea of helping him improve them, I start asking him questions, to see if I can understand the plot better, but still **I\'m missing characters, or clarifications, or anything else** that makes it hard for me to understand the story.\\n\\nIn the end, both his mother and I decided that the best thing would be for **one of us to also read the book**, so we could help him because otherwise, how would we know if he had missed something important or not?\\n\\nWell... something that initially didn\'t seem complicated, I realized was more difficult than I thought \ud83d\ude05.\\n\\nOne of the things I have noticed while reading the books is that **every one or two pages, there are words that I suspect he doesn\'t know**, like *exhalation*, *arrogant*, *seep*, *utopian*, *electoral campaign*, ..., so every time I read one of his books, I ask him to verify. \\n\\nIndeed, many he doesn\'t know, and I always tell him:\\n\\n> *Jos\xe9, when you don\'t understand something...ask what it means! Because if you don\'t, you\'re probably not understanding the story well.*\\n\\nI always do it... even when I\'m reading [Mikecrack](https://www.amazon.es/Libros-Mikecrack/s?rh=n%3A599364031%2Cp_27%3AMikecrack) stories to him and his brother in bed before sleeping, but no matter how much I repeat it... there comes a time when he stops asking.\\n\\nBut well, once the entire book is read and all the vocabulary is reviewed, we move on to the summary. There, my method consists of reminding him that every story has:\\n* A **beginning**, where something usually happens that disrupts the order and:\\n  1. Creates a problem to solve.\\n  2. Is the trigger for an adventure.\\n* Then there\'s the **development** (or middle), which is what is told in most of the book.\\n* Then there\'s an **end** (or conclusion), where the situation is resolved, or the story ends, and everything returns to normal.\\n* And besides this, there are some **characters** more important than others, without whom the story could not be told well.\\n\\nAnd then I ask him to, using those four elements, tell me what happens at the beginning, the most important things that happen before reaching the end, how everything is resolved and returns to normal, and while doing that, explain who each of the characters are.\\n\\nWell, as you can imagine, despite all attempts and trying to give him hints, because to be honest, **even I sometimes find it hard to summarize**... I can\'t get the summary to meet my expectations \ud83d\ude05, which ends in my frustration \ud83d\ude21, for which I then have to apologize to him, explaining that it is not his fault but my own frustration for not being able to help him \ud83d\ude1e.\\n\\n## Asking for help from the teacher\\n\\nSo I said to myself, \\"*OK Ra\xfal, you\'re not doing it right, ask the teacher for help!*\\" (and that\'s what I did).\\n\\nAfter talking to her, she gave me some advice. Since the books are quite long, she told me to ask Jos\xe9 to **write down \\"the main ideas\\" of each chapter on a separate sheet**, and then with all of them, make the summary.\\n\\nHere are the notes we made from the book [Anna Kadabra 13. Danger at the Mansion](https://www.amazon.es/Anna-Kadabra-13-Peligro-mansi%C3%B3n/dp/8408282468/ref=sr_1_1?crid=R7EP7BPESY29&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.-Kbuyc6r_LWofNFUvUlSTWZ-4Hc2RNoldj5qDm5r88wqdZ6Xo8tZroq96i3lQDZ7.g_pVjOolxe9dypGy1gyuKrKwDjT07Yceo3B5mxj8PqA&dib_tag=se&keywords=anna+kadabra+peligro+en+la+mansi%C3%B3n&qid=1717342071&s=books&sprefix=anna+kadabra+peligro+en+%2Cstripbooks%2C105&sr=1-1):\\n\\n[![Main ideas by chapter of: Anna Kadabra 13. Danger at the Mansion](/img/blogs/aprendiendo-a-aprender/ideas-principales-anna-kadabra-13.png)](/img/blogs/aprendiendo-a-aprender/ideas-principales-anna-kadabra-13.png)\\n\\nThe problem is that **when taking notes and making the summary, he sometimes missed important things**, like the fact that the supposed villain of the book wasn\'t so bad (but had been deceived), **or he focused on things that caught his attention but weren\'t relevant**, like an anecdote about a secondary character.\\n\\nBut of course... he\'s a child, **how do I explain to him what is a main character or event and what is a secondary one?**\\n\\nI tell him: \\"*if you remove that part of the story or character, can you still understand the story? Is it still the same?*\\" and he says something like... \\"*dad, if you remove anything... the story is no longer the same*\\", and he\'s not wrong \ud83e\udd23. So in the end, on more than one occasion, I end up telling him what I THINK is important and why.\\n\\n## Asking for help from my mother\\n\\nIn the end, I turned to my mother, because besides being my mother, she was my language teacher, and the teacher of many children in a school in Nerja.\\n\\nShe recommended a book that seemed promising: \\"[In primary school, learn to learn - 6: Learn to summarize and take notes](https://www.amazon.es/primaria-aprende-aprender-Educacion-Diversidad/dp/8477742847/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=2ZTNV4YYNDBSB&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.YvATtILgUCt4Sdi9g2stKg.l42L1kExAVdNFHsgPpk1jV1G5upoy6ID5Mw-EA_Hw1s&dib_tag=se&keywords=En+primaria+aprende+a+aprender+-+6%3A+Aprende+a+resumir+y+tomar+apuntes&qid=1717253519&s=books&sprefix=en+primaria+aprende+a+aprender+-+6+aprende+a+resumir+y+tomar+apuntes+%2Cstripbooks%2C110&sr=1-1)\\", and I, as an obedient son (sometimes \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c), bought it.\\n\\nAs you can see on Amazon, the book was published in 2001 (more than 20 years ago!), but what caught my attention was what I saw in the introduction:\\n\\n[![Learning to learn 6 - Learn to summarize and take notes](/img/blogs/aprendiendo-a-aprender/aprendiendo-a-aprender.png)](/img/blogs/aprendiendo-a-aprender/aprendiendo-a-aprender.png)\\n\\nSeeing that \\"in the past\\" it wasn\'t until the age of 10 that summaries were learned reassured me. This, along with the last meeting with my son\'s teacher, who again hinted that I shouldn\'t be so demanding with the summaries, **I\'ve decided to relax and see it from another perspective** \ud83e\uddd8\ud83d\udc86.\\n\\n## My conclusions\\n\\nI have to get used to the fact that the summary is not *that important* (for now). What is important is that my son:\\n* **Keeps enjoying reading**.\\n* **Continues developing his reading speed and comprehension**.\\n* **Learns vocabulary**.\\n* And above all, **doesn\'t start disliking reading** because after... there\'s going to be a time of \\"dad\'s anger\\" ;(.\\n\\nSo now what I\'ve asked him to do is that when he reads a book:\\n* Have a blank sheet of paper at hand.\\n* Write down all the words he doesn\'t know.\\n* And ask Alexa ([Echo Show](https://www.amazon.es/echo-show-5-3a-generacion/dp/B09B2S8WKD/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_ES=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1OUHNQYCKE44R&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.iltfLFjhhpdfcrA9zwPEASiiau-PIgl9VcVBJ0Oys_mCTQROVOODJpcW3qujKJ4uE1kn8QpTNL8Z-Ack1Tq9WU7C-LTEtxlvDoafnTJ_eg8HjePETtV-67qphoEQL1gvYpwxm_pR913C2qJrOLV7qzvzyiTtsKBCKr8OXVlmn6pXps9cPji2GZmCo1YhZnWudymyrsIxsywOMsAxpDflraEiQqz2Jfe357ryQ0o2Ttc.1wETnQEDVJoyYReccEOyXD41MFzajElaVfEmnAF04Wo&dib_tag=se&keywords=alexa+pantalla&qid=1717344456&s=books&sprefix=alexa+pantalla%2Cstripbooks%2C118&sr=1-1)) what they mean, and write them down. I was going to buy him a traditional dictionary... but honestly, I think this way will be faster and he will use it more.\\n\\nBecause from now on, when I read the book, I will see if he has done \\"his homework\\" and taken notes, because **now instead of putting so much emphasis on the summary, we will try to get him into the habit of looking up what he doesn\'t understand, so he can learn vocabulary and better understand what he reads**.\\n\\nHow do you see it?

Rey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-rey-rey-9022702a/), [Oskar Calvo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oskarcalvo) and I have proposed will take place, which will be \\"the continuation\\" of last year\'s Open Space where some of the challenges facing technical communities were discussed.\\n\\n## Communities in recess?\\n\\nAre the communities in recess?, are the communities having more problems now than before?\\n\\nAfter talking to many people, and in different forums, such as the Open Space, my perception is that there is a general feeling about the **drop of activity in many of the technology communities** (both in Spain and abroad) **in the last few years**, especially since the pandemic.\\n\\nBy \\"drop of activity\\" I mean a mix of things, but mainly I mean a lower attendance to meetings (face-to-face and online), interactions in mailing lists/IMs, etc.\\n\\nAnd this situation, worries those of us who energize communities.\\n\\nOne of the concerns that I have heard recurrently is that the average age of the people who are part of these communities is growing, or said with other words, that **it is difficult to attract and engage the new generations**. \\n\\nPersonally, I am reluctant to believe that this is because the experience offered by the communities no longer provides as much value to the new generations as other new formats, channels or \\"forums\\". \\n\\nBut before we continue... what is a community?\\n\\n## What is a community?\\n\\nOr rather, **what do I mean by community, or technology community**?\\n\\nPerhaps it is good to start with this question, since for example, during the Open Space, in my opinion, there were times when the conversation revolved around different concepts of \\"community\\". \\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Vibrant meeting space, technologists gather with faces animated by enthusiasm.](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/user-group-meetup-tech-community.png)](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/user-group-meetup-tech-community.png)\\n\\n</figure>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nIn my case, I talk about what is known as \\"[communities of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice)\\", which in short are **groups of people**(user groups, associations, meetups...) that:\\n\\n* **organize regular meetings** (face-to-face and/or online).\\n* **share a passion / profession / concerns, ... for technology** (software, hardware, methodologies or best practices, ...).\\n* mainly, **seek to collaborate with each other, voluntarily and altruistically**.\\n* they **seek the common benefit** above the particular one (including the particular interest of the organizations that may support/sponsor them).\\n* are **always open to new people**.\\n* feel part of the group and identify with it.\\n\\nSo, I just wanted to clarify that:\\n1. All this is in my experience and is based primarily on the type of communities I just described. \\n2. I believe that most of the ideas and tips shared in [the documents](/docs/category/-tech-communities), can be applied to this type of communities, whether they are local (in small and in big cities), as much as online/virtual, regardless of the fact that each one has its peculiarities.\\n\\nHaving said all of the above, it does not detract from the fact that some of **the tips can also be applied to people who are in the business of disseminating online content, or people who organize large conferences**. \\n\\n## What has changed?\\n\\nWhy do those of us who have been energizing communities have this feeling/perception?\\n\\nTo give some context, I started to get involved with this particular type of communities at the university (in ~2009), and since then [I have participated, contributed, founded and co-organized quite a few communities](https://www.rauljimenez.info/docs/about-me/open-culture#communities), organizing hundreds of meetings (of all kinds).\\n\\nBased on this experience, I would say that the feeling that activity is declining is mainly due to the fact that **it is harder for us to provide value** as we did before.\\n\\nNow the offer is wider and the attention is diversifying with the increase of communities, channels/media (Discords, Slacks, social newtwords, ...), but also the rise of [influencers](https://twitter.com/i/lists/828546487369990144/members). \\n\\n![The image shows a cluttered room, a person hiding behind his hands, drowned between screens and cables.](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/information-saturation-noise-social-networks.png)\\n\\nPersonally I also think that digital contact is eating more ground to the physical, just see that **almost everything is done through apps**: order food, a cab, talk / chat, procedures with the administration, ... even flirting! \ud83d\ude05 and I have no doubt that this also has consequences. \\n\\nThat is why I believe that it is not that communities do not provide value, but that they simply **have to take into account this change of context and reinvent/modernize themselves**. Remember, as Albert Einstein said, \\"_The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results_.\\"\\n\\nI hope that sharing some of the **advice** I heard at the Open Space, and some of my own, will serve to **help refloat some communities and help new ones to emerge**.\\n\\n> A book I really like that talks about adapting to change is [Who Moved My Cheese?](https://www.amazon.com/-/es/Spencer-Johnson/dp/0399144463/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_US=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=39BAFS7MV20R5&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zoT19YfaR2b08zVkjZe2e0OGdTMvrcOsvxtxkGnEU8moy5ou07-LLppVg8nedZprast3hMhTFCJaue9jlJgmw6ZsGnYK7H_L4l-zmECV3z4vsCf3Kb_4qbqZocy25grVymjCcjGOP4h2gaGylJ11DaDG5sN6Kk6FN_eJhS3y2OgVl2kcp5Lpm4xt-0TcK40SOUV0_mJS9wcVA0Nv14Qo0yP1jiKp2qbjKGpntuuDnQY.9rIUivJpeFpsMntNHayamLjJElSNfNsjOGx_HRWO-qw&dib_tag=se&keywords=Who+took+my+cheese%3F&qid=1712813883&sprefix=who+took+my+cheese+%2Caps%2C217&sr=8-1) \ud83e\uddc0\ud83d\udc01.\\n\\n## Anatomy of communities\\n\\nAnd before I finish, I wanted to share some ideas and resources to share my understanding of communities.\\n\\nThe most basic are the **degrees of involvement**. I used to explain them this way to my Esri colleagues several years ago (~2017):\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Anatomy of a community diagram](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/anatomy-of-a-community.jpg)](/img/blogs/resources-for-technical-communities/anatomy-of-a-community.jpg)\\n\\n<figcaption>Anatomy of a community.</figcaption>\\n</figure>\\n\\n</div>\\n\\nAfter that, [Jorge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorgebarrachina/) taught me several theories:  \\n* The *[Orbit Model](https://orbit.love/model)*, which serves as a model to explain that to increase the feeling of belonging to a group, it is necessary to increase the number of interactions and positive impacts between people, and that bonds are forged.\\n* The [1% rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule), which I use to adjust expectations that no more than ~1% will help to energize, nor ~10% participate, although really **measuring this is often quite subjective, just like trying to measure a friendship** (because at the end of the day, that\'s what they are).\\n* [The Community Maturity Model](https://communityroundtable.com/what-we-do/research/community-maturity-model/), an interesting framework for classifying different types of communities.\\n\\n<div style={{textAlign: \'center\'}}>\\n\\n<figure>\\n\\n[![Community Maturity Model -

It is one of the largest [events for developers that is held annually in Spain](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1571289000886910977). It is well attended and draws strong participation from around 50 Spanish technical communities.\\n\\n![Photo of the venue\'s lobby during event registration](./commitconf23-checkin.jpg)\\n\\n## Why attend conferences like CommitConf?\\n\\nAt the conference, developers were brought together to **retrain, discover, and share new insight and knowledge about our profession**. For example, attendees shared information about:\\n\\n* New tools and languages.\\n* New capabilities for the tools and languages already used by the community.\\n* How companies solve different software development challenges.\\n* Best practices in accessibility, security, and design patterns.\\n* New trends.\\n\\nAdditionally, the conference provided a place to meet new people and reconnect with those already known. At events like this, it\u2019s not uncommon to run into people you know! In my case, I bumped into some of my former colleagues, and some developers who use **[ArcGIS to create Location-Aware apps or map applications](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/)**.\\n\\n![Selfies taken by Raul with other developers during the event.](./commitconf23-developers.jpg)\\n\\n## What made this conference special?\\n\\nThis event, like many others, gives us, developers, the opportunity to **present talks, workshops, and even [Open Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology)**.\\n\\nFor attendees, a unique factor that sets this event apart from others is the system used to create the event\u2018s agenda, **allowing the communities themselves to be involved in the selection process of talks**. This system is called [Koliseo](https://koliseo.com/) and is free for anyone to use.\\n\\n## Why submit a proposal?\\n\\nGoing to an event like CommitConf **is an opportunity to learn from and contribute to the developer community**. And, there are many different motivations for a person to send a proposal.\\n\\n* There are people who simply **enjoy sharing knowledge and experiences**. \\n* Other attendees want to **increase the visibility of their company** and to raise awareness of the cool work they do, **with the hope of attracting new talent**. \\n* Some attendees want to **create a personal brand**.\\n* While others want to **discuss and find solutions to a problem with their colleagues**.\\n\\nAnd if you are lucky enough to have a proposal accepted, as in my case, you can **attend the speakers\u2019 dinner** the day before the event, where you meet a lot of experts on different topics \ud83d\ude0d. \\n\\n## What did Esri bring to the conference?\\n\\nFrom the company I work for ([Esri](http://esri.com/)), they have always encouraged me to attend to conferences and to send proposals that I thought might be relevant to other developers.\\n\\nThis time, I presented a variety of proposals:\\n\\n* DataViz & Map Optimization\\n* Designing Beautiful and Intelligent Maps\\n* Using and Creating Collections in Postman Like a Pro\\n* **\ud83d\udd11\ud83d\udd12 OAuth, OpenID Connect and JWT for Dummies**\\n\\nI was lucky that the conference organizers accepted \u201cOAuth, OpenID Connect, and JWT for Dummies\u201d because it gave me the **opportunity to share what these auth standards are and how they work**. I showed practical examples based on some of the resources that we have created from [Esri\'s Developer Experience team](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0VMTWv3XRwWL4zG7rB8SlHkE5XXbd5OW), like the **[Authentication workspace in Postman](https://www.postman.com/esridevs/workspace/authentication-in-arcgis/overview)**.\\n\\n![Photo of Raul\'s talk during his talk on oAuth showing Raul speaking and the audience of about 100 people.](./commitconf23-raul-jimenez-ortega.jpg)\\n\\nIn case you want, you can **[check the slides out here](https://bit.ly/oauth-commit)**. If you are interested in the topic and want me to repeat this talk online, just let me know in the comments!\\n\\n## What did I learn at the conference?\\n\\nBelow are some of the takeaways from the sessions that I attended:\\n\\n* **Local Communities Outside Big Cities (Open Space)**: This session was super interesting. I had the opportunity to share tips and ideas to overcome challenges in creating and maintaining developer communities with approximately thirty other people. Among them were representatives from different communities about Python, Software Crafting, Data, Machine Learning, generalists\u2019 communities, Free Software, GNU/Linux, DevOps, Drupal, and us representing the [GeoDevelopers community](https://meetup.com/es-ES/geo-developers).\\n\\n> **Note**: After the session, I decided to create a guide with what we learned and our own experience. If you are interested, save the article in favourites because we will add it **[here]** in a few weeks.\\n\\n\\n![Photo of the Open Space on communities showing about thirty attendees seated in a circle.](./commitcont23-openspace.jpg)\\n\\n* **Detecting Web Performance Issues with Chrome DevTools**: [@nucliweb](https://twitter.com/nucliweb) gave an overview of the Chrome DevTools and showed us how they keep adding new tools like [Recorder](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/recorder/) and [Coverage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/coverage/) to help evaluate your web performance and optimize it. Also, he showed us how the new AVIF image format improves WebP performance. More info at [web.dev](https://web.dev/).\\n\\n* **Don\u2019t Yell at Me, I Can\u2019t See You**: [@javierabadia](https://twitter.com/javierabadia) and [@jameshedaweng](https://twitter.com/jameshedaweng) explained to us how to divide the responsibilities between an Engineering Manager and a Product Manager to avoid failure when creating a product. In summary, a PM must be responsible for *what* features to add and *why*, and the EM in the *how* and the *who*. The *when* should be a shared responsibility.\\n\\n* **Why I Decided to Pursue the Developer Relations Path**: [@kinisoftware](https://twitter.com/kinisoftware) told us about his experience as a Staff Developer Relations Engineer, where he works to promote the expertise of Criteo\u2019s technical team by facilitating participation in events and communities.\\n\\n* **Testing Web Accessibility**: [@bolonio](https://twitter.com/bolonio) showed us a multitude of tools and resources for testing web accessibility: [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y), [jest-axe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-axe), [axe-core/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@axe-core/cli), [pa11y](https://pa11y.org/), [pa11y-ci](https://github.com/pa11y/pa11y-ci), [axe chrome extension](http://deque.com/axe), [arc toolkit](http://paciellogroup.com/toolkit), [accessibilityinsights.io](http://accessibilityinsights.io/), [wave.webaim.org](https://wave.webaim.org/), and more.\\n\\n* **The Mistake of Becoming a Manager**: [@npatarino](https://twitter.com/npatarino) explained to us that becoming a manager of people is not the only way to have leadership or increase your salary. He said that for those senior software engineers who want to continue growing, there are other positions such as Staff Software Engineer, Principal Software Engineer, Distinguished Software Engineer and Technical Fellow.\\n\\n* **Past, Present and Future of EducaMadrid**: [@asanzdiego](https://twitter.com/asanzdiego) talked to us about the educational platform of the Community of Madrid that he leads; he told us about the technical challenges they suffered during the pandemic, when the number of active users grew exponentially, along with the strengths and limitations of his team and his technological stack based on free software.\\n\\n\\n![Composition of photographs of different sessions attended by Raul.](./commitconf23-techsessions.jpg)\\n\\nIn summary, if you don\'t use to go to developer conferences, **I hope my experience has encouraged you and given you arguments to attend in the future**.

In my opinion, because:\\n\\n1.  **It forces me to be more structured**, for example:\\n    -   When it comes to work, I try to document all procedures.\\n    -   Procedures or work that I later share; for example, in articles on this blog like: [Partner Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2014/04/06/pacto-de-socios/), [Template for Creating an Analytics Plan](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/2014/01/06/plantilla-para-crear-un-plan-de-analitica/), etc.\\n    -   I tend to use many task management tools that I later reuse in my work.\\n2.  Also, **I make myself write more** about what I have done so I don\'t forget it\\n    1.  For example, my [life summary posts](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419185718/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/category/sobre-mi/) which also serve to keep my friends updated on how I am.\\n    2.

Well, let me give you several examples:\\n\\n- Identifying the [best areas to live within a city](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://uji.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Filter/index.html?appid=96848387cd1a4ffeaf0bbc1a98699640) (based on certain criteria)\\n- Solving problems like: [what is the best location for my next business?](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.forbes.com/sites/barbarathau/2014/04/24/how-big-data-helps-retailers-like-starbucks-pick-store-locations-an-unsung-key-to-retail-success/)\\n- Creating [location-aware mobile applications](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.fastcolabs.com/3028819/the-big-question-in-retail-now-is-what-are-you-doing-with-geotriggers) that incorporate behaviors associated with their location.\\n- Setting up [dynamic and interactive 3D scenarios](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.arcgis.com/apps/CEWebViewer/viewer.html?3dWebScene=9c0e319bfaff4d33a0fe2da97c2c3fd7) (similar to Second Life)\\n- Representing and communicating large amounts of information in a more understandable ([map of England](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://illustreets.co.uk/explore-england)) or attractive way ([map with incredible places](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/?appid=35926d0e1c7741b59948ca45f4f33b3a)).\\n- [Conducting simulations](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://mappingpoint.blogspot.com.es/2014/01/terremotos-en-la-isla-del-hierro.html), analyzing geolocated data ([e.g., purchases](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://grupoweb.upf.es:8080/quartz/)) and predicting future situations ([queues in stores, etc](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/https://www.centrodeinnovacionbbva.com/en/pages/29293-winners)).\\n- [Other examples](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.geoases.com/inspiracion/)\\n\\nSo, it can be used to solve problems, optimize processes, communicate better, etc., and therefore, the applications are numerous and can be useful for individuals, companies, and governments.\\n\\nIf you are a programmer and are interested in learning more about this field, I invite you to **[join the Geo Developers Meetup](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438/http://www.meetup.com/Geo-Developers/)** that I created to organize talks, workshops, etc., and help each other by sharing knowledge.\\n\\nSee you soon! ![:D](https://web.archive.org/web/20150419172438im_/http://www.rauljimenez.info/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif)"},{"id":"invertir-en-formacion-online","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/invertir-en-formacion-online","editUrl":"https://github.com/hhkaos/hhkaos.github.io/tree/master/blog/2014-01-04/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2014-01-04/index.md","title":"\ud83d\udcb0 Investing in online training","description":"Many people still hesitate to take the step of paying a fee to subscribe to a good online training service; and today I wanted to advocate for it because I believe it is more cost-effective compared to other formal training alternatives.

Here are a few other platforms with MOOCs that follow this line where you can find free courses (with paid certifications): [Coursera](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://coursera.org/), [Miriadax](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://miriadax.net/), [CodeAcademy](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/http://www.codecademy.com/), and [EDX](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.edx.org/) (_thanks Pino for this last one!_).\\n\\nWell, in my case I pay a **$25 per month** subscription on Codeschool, which over these months (including discounts) has amounted to about \u20ac125, and although this may seem like a considerable amount, I think if we analyze what I\'ve gained in return it offers a different perspective.\\n\\nFor example, during this time I have [completed 9](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/users/227734) of the 36 courses they have available:\\n\\n\u2013 [Javascript Road Trip Part 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1) **(Free)**  \\n\u2013 [Javascript Road Trip Part 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-2)  \\n\u2013 [Javascript Road Trip Part 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-3)  \\n\u2013 [Coffeescript](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/coffeescript)  \\n\u2013 [Real-Time-Web with Node.js](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/real-time-web-with-nodejs)  \\n\u2013 [Discover DevTools](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/discover-devtools) **(Free)**  \\n\u2013 [Fundamentals of Design](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/fundamentals-of-design)  \\n\u2013 [Try Git](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git) **(Free)**  \\n\u2013 [Try Ruby](https://web.archive.org/web/20160531110822/https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-ruby)\\n\\nDoing the math, each paid course has cost me about \u20ac20 and I have invested ... I would say between 4 and 8 hours in each. If we do the math, I think it comes at a very reasonable price since the courses are of tremendous quality and include a lot of practical exercises that I believe **are making me a better professional**.\\n\\nWhat do you think about this, in **comparison to other training options**: workshops, training sessions, master\'s programs, etc. **Don\'t you think it\'s a good price?**"}]}')}}]);
